TI  - Dengue in India.
PG  - 373-90
AB  - Dengue virus belongs to family Flaviviridae, having four serotypes that spread by 
      the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. It causes a wide spectrum of illness from 
      mild asymptomatic illness to severe fatal dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock 
      syndrome (DHF/DSS). Approximately 2.5 billion people live in dengue-risk regions 
      with about 100 million new cases each year worldwide. The cumulative dengue diseases 
      burden has attained an unprecedented proportion in recent times with sharp increase 
      in the size of human population at risk. Dengue disease presents highly complex 
      pathophysiological, economic and ecologic problems. In India, the first epidemic of 
      clinical dengue-like illness was recorded in Madras (now Chennai) in 1780 and the 
      first virologically proved epidemic of dengue fever (DF) occurred in Calcutta (now 
      Kolkata) and Eastern Coast of India in 1963-1964. During the last 50 years a large 
      number of physicians have treated and described dengue disease in India, but the 
      scientific studies addressing various problems of dengue disease have been carried 
      out at limited number of centres. Achievements of Indian scientists are 
      considerable; however, a lot remain to be achieved for creating an impact. This 
      paper briefly reviews the extent of work done by various groups of scientists in 
      this country.

TI  - Dengue infections in travellers.
PG  - 28-32

AB  - Dengue has been designated a major international public health problem by the World 
      Health Organization (WHO). It is endemic in most tropical and sub-tropical 
      countries, which are also popular tourist destinations. Travellers are not only at 
      significant risk of acquiring dengue but they also contribute to its spread to 
      non-endemic regions. Furthermore, they may serve as sentinels to alert the 
      international community to epidemics in dengue-endemic regions. GeoSentinel, a 
      global surveillance network, monitors all travel-related illnesses and estimates 
      that dengue accounts for 2% of all illness in travellers returning from 
      dengue-endemic regions. In fact, in travellers returning from South-east Asia, 
      dengue is now a more frequent cause of febrile illness than malaria. Dengue-infected 
      travellers returning home to countries where the vector exists can place the local 
      population at risk of further spread of the disease with subsequent autochthonous 
      cycles of infection. The true incidence of dengue amongst travellers may be 
      underestimated because of variability in reporting requirements in different 
      countries and under-diagnosis owing to the non-specific clinical presentation of the 
      disease. Risk factors for acquiring dengue include duration of stay, season of 
      travel and epidemic activity at the destination. Any pre-travel advice on the risks 
      of developing dengue infections should consider these factors.

TI  - The dengue situation in Africa.
PG  - 18-21
LID - 10.1179/2046904712Z.00000000048 [doi]
AB  - Dengue outbreaks and epidemics have been reported in all regions of Africa, and it 
      is believed that all four dengue virus serotypes are in circulation. Available data 
      suggest that dengue is endemic to 34 African countries and that Aedes aegypti 
      mosquitoes--the primary vector for dengue transmission--are known to be present in 
      all but five countries. Whether populations in Africa are susceptible to dengue at 
      the same rates as in Asia and Latin America is difficult to determine from the 
      available data. Several factors may affect the transmission of dengue in Africa, 
      including vector efficiency, viral infectivity, host vulnerability and environmental 
      factors, such as increasing urbanisation. Current dengue prevention strategies in 
      Africa focus on vector control, although the primary aim of such efforts is 
      typically the prevention of malaria. Further research is needed to characterise the 
      epidemiology of dengue in Africa and to better understand the factors involved in 
      differences in vulnerability to dengue across Africa.

AB  - Dengue is one of the most important vector-borne viral diseases. With climate change 
      and the convenience of travel, dengue is spreading beyond its usual tropical and 
      subtropical boundaries. Infection with dengue virus (DENV) causes diseases ranging 
      widely in severity, from self-limited dengue fever to life-threatening dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Vascular leakage, thrombocytopenia, and 
      hemorrhage are the major clinical manifestations associated with severe DENV 
      infection, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. Besides the direct effects of the 
      virus, immunopathogenesis is also involved in the development of dengue disease. 
      Antibody-dependent enhancement increases the efficiency of virus infection and may 
      suppress type I interferon-mediated antiviral responses. Aberrant activation of T 
      cells and overproduction of soluble factors cause an increase in vascular 
      permeability. DENV-induced autoantibodies against endothelial cells, platelets, and 
      coagulatory molecules lead to their abnormal activation or dysfunction. Molecular 
      mimicry between DENV proteins and host proteins may explain the cross-reactivity of 
      DENV-induced autoantibodies. Although no licensed dengue vaccine is yet available, 
      several vaccine candidates are under development. For the development of a safe and 
      effective dengue vaccine, the immunopathogenic complications of dengue disease need 
      to be considered.

AB  - Dengue is a systemic arthropod-borne viral disease of major global public health 
      importance. At least 2.5 billion people who live in areas of the world where dengue 
      occurs are at risk of developing dengue fever (DF) and its severe complications, 
      dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Repeated 
      reemergences of dengue in sudden explosive epidemics often cause public alarm and 
      seriously stress healthcare systems. The control of dengue is further challenged by 
      the lack of effective therapies, vaccines, and point-of-care diagnostics. Despite 
      years of study, even its pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. This article 
      discusses recent advances in dengue research and identifies challenging gaps in 
      research on dengue clinical evaluation, diagnostics, epidemiology, immunology, 
      therapeutics, vaccinology/clinical trials research, vector biology, and vector 
      ecology. Although dengue is a major global tropical pathogen, epidemiologic and 
      disease control considerations in this article emphasize dengue in the Americas.

AB  - Research into the pathogenesis of dengue fever has exploded over the last 
      half-century, with issues that were considered simple becoming more complex as 
      additional data are found. This has led to the development of a number of 
      controversies that are being studied across the globe and debated in the literature. 
      In this paper, the following six controversies are analysed and, where possible, 
      resolved: the 1997 World Health Organization (WHO) case definition of dengue 
      haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is not useful; DHF is not significantly associated with 
      secondary dengue infection; DHF results from infection with a 'virulent' dengue 
      virus; DHF is owing to abnormal T-cell responses; DHF results from auto-immune 
      responses; and DHF results from direct infection of endothelial cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An epidemic of type 4 dengue was raging in the Pacific from 2008 to 
      2010. During this period, several patients were hospitalized at the Hospital Centre 
      of Tahiti for neurological disorders occurring during a dengue fever. These events 
      are not the typical picture, which is represented by a flu-like syndrome and 
      sometimes, in severe cases, a haemorrhagic syndrome or shock. METHOD: We have 
      established a review of the literature reporting the cases of dengue fever 
      associated with neurological disorders with the terms "dengue" and "neurology". 
      Despite the retrospective nature and incomplete data, we attempted to establish the 
      epidemiological characteristics of these events, to give an order of frequency of 
      these symptoms and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved. RESULTS: Among 
      patients with neurological disorders occurring during a dengue fever, disorders of 
      central nervous system are the most common. Among disorders of central nervous 
      system, encephalopathy is by far the most encountered. CONCLUSION: None of observed 
      neurologic disorders presenting with specific manifestation, discussion of dengue as 
      etiology in endemic areas or in return from endemic area is well-founded.

AB  - Dengue is a major cause of illness among travelers and a threat to military troops 
      operating in areas to which it is endemic. Before and during World War II, dengue 
      frequently occurred in US military personnel in Asia and the South Pacific. From the 
      1960s into the 1990s, dengue often occurred in US troops in Vietnam, the 
      Philippines, Somalia, and Haiti. We found attack rates as high as 80% and periods of 
      convalescence up to 3-1/2 weeks beyond the acute illness. The increase in dengue 
      throughout the world suggests that it will remain a problem for military personnel 
      until an effective vaccine is licensed.

TI  - Diagnosis of dengue: an update.
PG  - 895-907
LID - 10.1586/eri.12.76 [doi]
AB  - Early diagnosis of dengue, the most common mosquito-borne disease globally, remains 
      challenging. Dengue presents initially as undifferentiated fever, with symptoms 
      becoming more pathognomonic in the later stages of illness. This limits the 
      timeliness in the delivery of appropriate supportive interventions. Laboratory tests 
      are useful for diagnosis although the short-lived viremia and the presence of 
      secondary infection with one of the four heterologous viral serotypes collectively 
      complicate the choice and interpretation of laboratory tests. In this article, the 
      authors review the various approaches for diagnosis of dengue and discuss the 
      appropriate tests to use, including when a dengue vaccine, which is in the late 
      stages of development, is licensed for use. The ensuing reduced dengue prevalence 
      could make diagnosis for vaccine efficacy and escape-mutant monitoring even more 
      challenging.

PG  - 22-7
LID - 10.1179/2046904712Z.00000000049 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever (DF) is endemic in tropical and subtropical zones and the prevalence is 
      increasing across South-east Asia, Africa, the Western Pacific and the Americas. In 
      recent years, the spread of unplanned urbanisation, with associated substandard 
      housing, overcrowding and deterioration in water, sewage and waste management 
      systems, has created ideal conditions for increased transmission of the dengue virus 
      in tropical urban centres. While dengue infection has traditionally been considered 
      a paediatric disease, the age distribution of dengue has been rising and more cases 
      have been observed in adolescents and adults. Furthermore, the development of 
      tourism in the tropics has led to an increase in the number of tourists who become 
      infected, most of whom are adults. Symptoms and risk factors for dengue haemorrhagic 
      fever (DHF) and severe dengue differ between children and adults, with 
      co-morbidities and incidence in more elderly patients associated with greater risk 
      of mortality. Treatment options for DF and DHF in adults, as for children, centre 
      round fluid replacement (either orally or intravenously, depending on severity) and 
      antipyretics. Further data are needed on the optimal treatment of adult patients.

AB  - The presence of dengue virus has been detected using neutralization and 
      haemagglutination inhibition antibodies in local populations in Pakistan since the 
      1960s. However, the first epidemic was not reported until 1994. This was followed by 
      some cases in 1995, but the disease was confined to the port city of Karachi. Since 
      2006, dengue epidemics have occurred every year and the range has extended to most 
      cities in Pakistan. Dengue now affects thousands of people and has caused hundreds 
      of deaths. It has become a major health problem in Pakistan, and it is likely to 
      become an even greater health problem in the coming years. This review gives an 
      insight into the dengue situation from the early 1960s to the most recent epidemics 
      in Pakistan, and also describes the primary vector of this disease (Aedes aegypti) 
      in Pakistan. As such, it provides the first comprehensive review of the emergence of 
      this important public health problem.

PG  - 522-30
LID - 10.3109/00365548.2012.669044 [doi]
AB  - In tropical countries and possibly elsewhere, dengue fever can be confused with 
      other common tropical infections like enteric fever, leptospirosis, typhus fever, 
      malaria, etc. Many of these illnesses can present in significant numbers after 
      rains, and because of similar early presentations, can cause confusion in 
      decision-making. With global warming, these diseases can assume significant 
      proportions even in non-endemic areas. Identifying these illnesses in a non-immune 
      returning traveller is equally challenging. Recognition of these diseases is 
      important to diagnose them and treat them early, in order to avoid potentially fatal 
      complications. This review is an attempt to highlight important clinical and 
      laboratory differences among dengue fever-like illnesses.

PG  - 39-46
LID - 10.1007/s00253-012-3958-7 [doi]
AB  - Virus-like particles (VLPs) are shell-like viruses that lack virus-specific genetic 
      materials. Many viral-structured proteins can assemble into VLPs, which mimic the 
      overall structure of virus particles and can elicit strong immune responses in a 
      host. Dengue viruses (DENVs), from the genus Flavivirus, are transmitted to humans 
      through the bites of an infected Aedes mosquito. DENVs cause several diseases that 
      prevailed mainly in tropical and subtropical areas. However, effective treatment 
      measures and preventive strategies for dengue diseases are still lacking. The 
      present minireview summarized the assembly and maturation of DENVs, the strategies 
      and effective factors for dengue VLP construction, and the application of DENV VLPs.

TI  - Commercial dengue rapid diagnostic tests for point-of-care application: recent 
      evaluations and future needs?

AB  - Dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome (DF/DHF/DSS) are 
      tropical diseases that cause significant humanitarian and economic hardship. It is 
      estimated that more than 2.5 billion people are at risk of infection and more than 
      100 countries have endemic dengue virus transmission. Laboratory tests are essential 
      to provide an accurate diagnosis of dengue virus infection so that appropriate 
      treatment and patient management may be administered. In many dengue endemic 
      settings, laboratory diagnostic resources are limited and simple rapid diagnostic 
      tests (RDTs) provide opportunities for point-of-care diagnosis. This paper addresses 
      current issues relating to the application of commercial dengue RDTs for the 
      diagnosis of acute dengue virus infection, recent diagnostic evaluations, and 
      identifies future needs.

TI  - Dendritic cell apoptosis and the pathogenesis of dengue.
PG  - 2736-53
LID - 10.3390/v4112736 [doi]
AB  - Dengue viruses and other members of the Flaviviridae family are emerging human 
      pathogens. Dengue is transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes. 
      Following infection through the bite, cells of the hematopoietic lineage, like 
      dendritic cells, are the first targets of dengue virus infection. Dendritic cells 
      (DCs) are key antigen presenting cells, sensing pathogens, processing and presenting 
      the antigens to T lymphocytes, and triggering an adaptive immune response. Infection 
      of DCs by dengue virus may induce apoptosis, impairing their ability to present 
      antigens to T cells, and thereby contributing to dengue pathogenesis. This review 
      focuses on general mechanisms by which dengue virus triggers apoptosis, and possible 
      influence of DC-apoptosis on dengue disease severity.

TI  - The revised WHO dengue case classification: does the system need to be modified?
PG  - 33-8
LID - 10.1179/2046904712Z.00000000052 [doi]
AB  - There has been considerable debate regarding the value of both the 1997 and 2009 
      World Health Organization (WHO) dengue case classification criteria for its 
      diagnosis and management. Differentiation between classic dengue fever (DF) and 
      dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) or severe dengue is a key aspect of dengue case 
      classification. The geographic expansion of dengue and its increased incidence in 
      older age groups have contributed to the limited applicability of the 1997 case 
      definitions. Clinical experience of dengue suggests that the illness presents as a 
      spectrum of disease instead of distinct phases. However, despite the rigid grouping 
      of dengue into DF, DHF and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), overlap between the 
      different manifestations has often been observed, which has affected clinical 
      management and triage of patients. The findings of the DENCO study evaluating the 
      1997 case definitions formed the basis of the revised 2009 WHO case definitions, 
      which classified the illness into dengue with and without warning signs and severe 
      dengue. Although the revised scheme is more sensitive to the diagnosis of severe 
      dengue, and beneficial to triage and case management, there remain issues with its 
      applicability. It is considered by many to be too broad, requiring more specific 
      definition of warning signs. Quantitative research into the predictive value of 
      these warning signs on patient outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of the new 
      classification system is required to ascertain whether the new classification system 
      requires further modification, or whether elements of both classification systems 
      can be combined.

AB  - Dengue is a serious public health problem worldwide. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS), 
      the severe form of dengue fever, can cause death within 12-24 hours if appropriate 
      treatment is not promptly administered. For patients with DSS and the 30% of 
      non-shocked dengue patients who require intravenous fluid therapy, a range of 
      solutions is available for plasma volume support. Crystalloid solutions, such as 
      normal 0·9% saline or Ringer's lactate, are the ones most commonly used. In severe 
      cases, colloid solutions may be administered for their greater osmotic effect, 
      although they carry a greater risk of adverse events. This paper summarises the key 
      clinical data, comparing fluid regimens in children with severe dengue, and 
      concludes that the majority of patients with DSS can be treated successfully with 
      isotonic crystalloid solutions. If a colloid is thought necessary, a 
      medium-molecular-weight preparation that combines good initial plasma volume support 
      with good intravascular persistence and an acceptable side-effect profile is 
      optimal. Further research should aim to determine whether there are benefits to 
      early treatment with colloids, and which colloid solution is most effective for 
      resuscitation of DSS patients.

AB  - Dengue is a systemic infectious disease of viral etiology, transmitted by Aedes 
      mosquitoes. It causes between 50 and 100 million cases annually over 100 countries. 
      In most of the cases it presents as influenza-like illness or undifferentiated fever 
      and more than 500,000 patients develop dengue hemorrhagic fever. In America, dengue 
      fever is considered the most important resurgent disease and its hemorrhagic form is 
      becoming more relevant, especially given the steady increase in the number of 
      deaths. The first outbreaks of dengue in America were described in 1635. Since the 
      apparition of dengue hemorrhagic fever, in 1962, it has been considered a public 
      health problem because half of the population lives in endemic areas. The purpose of 
      this paper is to carry a briefly review of the epidemiology, clinical features, 
      pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of dengue fever, as well as create 
      recommendations in order to improve the quality of care and decrease mortality in 
      these patients.

AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection caused by a flavivirus. I describe the ocular 
      findings observed in two patients infected with dengue virus who presented with 
      acute onset of loss of vision preceded by febrile illness, malaise, generalized 
      fatigue headache, and maculopapular rash. Ophthalmologic evaluation in each patient 
      revealed a normal anterior segment. Vitreous cells were noted in one patient. 
      Ophthalmoscopy revealed multiple foci of retinochoroiditis, vasculitis, cotton-wool 
      spots, and retinal hemorrhages. The healing of the lesion showed discrete atrophic 
      and pigmented retinochoroiditic scars. Fluorescein angiography displayed early 
      hypofluorescence and late hyperfluorescence suggestive of leakage. The healed scars 
      showed late staining. The serologic testing showed elevated IgG antibodies, and one 
      had high IgM antibodies to dengue virus. Ocular findings of dengue fever consist of 
      multifocal areas of retinochoroiditis and may lead to loss of vision. In Saudi 
      Arabia, dengue fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis of 
      multifocal chorioretinal lesions and retinal vasculitis.

AB  - Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne, human viral disease in many tropical 
      and sub-tropical areas. In India the disease has been essentially described in the 
      form of case series. We reviewed the epidemiology of dengue in India to improve 
      understanding of its evolution in the last 50 years and support the development of 
      effective local prevention and control measures. Early outbreak reports showed a 
      classic epidemic pattern of transmission with sporadic outbreaks, with low to 
      moderate numbers of cases, usually localized to urban centres and neighbouring 
      regions, but occasionally spreading and causing larger epidemics. Trends in recent 
      decades include: larger and more frequent outbreaks; geographic expansion of endemic 
      transmission; spread of the disease from urban to peri-urban and rural areas; an 
      increasing proportion of severe cases and deaths; and progression to 
      hyperendemicity, particularly in large urban areas. The global picture of dengue in 
      India is currently that of a largely endemic country. Understanding demographic 
      differences in infection rates and severity of dengue has important implications for 
      the planning and implementation of effective public health prevention and control 
      measures and targeting of future vaccination campaigns.

TI  - Dengue and dengue-like outbreaks in the past: the case of the Macau epidemic fever 
      of 1874.

LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2012.03.006 [doi]
AB  - Historical sources abound in references to outbreaks of a disease resembling dengue 
      fever. Medical observers reported on its rapid onset and great expansion in the 
      population, the diversity and changeability of its clinical features and its overall 
      mildness. In 1874, an epidemic disease with fever, rash and rheumatic pains as main 
      symptoms broke out in the Portuguese colony of Macau, South China. It was similar to 
      the epidemic disease which swept the colony 2 years before during the socalled 
      dengue pandemic of 1870-1873. The 1874 epidemic disease was variously labeled by 
      local physicians, including dengue fever. In his report on the disease, Dr. Lúcio 
      Augusto da Silva, hence at the head of the health services of Macau, discussed on 
      the nature of the epidemic febrile disease. Here, I review the data on the 1874 
      epidemic outbreak and put them in the context of historical dengue-like outbreaks. A 
      possible Chikungunya etiology of the disease is postulated.

TI  - New development in the diagnosis of dengue infections.
PG  - 99-112
LID - 10.1517/17530059.2012.718759 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dengue is of major concern around the world. Having no pathognomonic 
      features that reliably distinguish it from other febrile illnesses, laboratory 
      diagnosis is important for confirmation. Ideally, a dengue diagnostic test should be 
      sensitive, specific and applicable from the onset of disease to 10 days 
      post-infection. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the pro and cons of currently 
      available diagnostic arrays as well as evaluations that have been conducted by 
      numerous groups using both in-house and commercialized kits were assessed and 
      reviewed. We also probed into the challenges and hurdles of applying these assays 
      worldwide. This review also glimpsed at newer technologies that may be invaluable in 
      the future of dengue diagnostics. EXPERT OPINION: To diagnose dengue, an 
      understanding of the complex immune responses and the clinical features of this 
      disease is essential. The MAC-ELISA currently remains the assay of choice but needs 
      further evaluation and confirmation. Viral RT-PCR and NS1 have gained interest but 
      their inconsistencies and great variability are of concern. Combinations of these 
      tests have improved sensitivity but specificity issues still exist. Consequently, 
      the favorable method of diagnosing dengue currently is to run multiple tests or 
      obtain a paired sample so that more than one parameter is detected or a rising titer 
      is demonstrated.

PG  - 14-7

AB  - Dengue infection is a significant and escalating public health problem in Latin 
      America. Its re-emergence and subsequent rise in the region over the past 50 years 
      has largely been caused by a combination of a lack of political will, the radical 
      growth of urban populations, migration flow and insufficient financial resources. 
      Its increased incidence has been compounded by climate change, poor sanitation and 
      extreme poverty, which lead to more breeding sites of the mosquito vector Aedes 
      aegypti. In order to control dengue effectively, an integrated approach 
      incorporating vector management and environmental and social solutions is required. 
      To achieve success, these programmes require commitment and responses at both 
      national and community level. The development of a vaccine is a vital tool in the 
      fight against dengue. For successful introduction, those implementing vaccination 
      need to be educated on the value of such a strategy. Effective political leadership, 
      innovative financial mechanisms and co-operation across all disciplines, sectors and 
      national borders are essential to eradication of the disease.

TI  - Dengue and chikungunya in travelers: recent updates.
PG  - 523-9
LID - 10.1097/QCO.0b013e328356ffd5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) cause 
      significant morbidity in many world regions and their epidemiology, pathogenesis, 
      vector issues, and control and prevention continue to fascinate researchers. This 
      review focuses on the progress in these areas in the past 2 years. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Recent studies have highlighted the features of the epidemiology of DENV and CHIKV 
      in Africa, some places of transmission being detected through travelers as 
      sentinels. Autochthonous transmission of both viruses has been documented in France, 
      raising concern regarding the potential for outbreaks where a competent vector, 
      Aedes albopictus, is present. Some aspects of immune response following DENV and 
      CHIKV infections have been elucidated. New diagnostic techniques for DENV have been 
      explored as well as treatment for CHIKV. Research on Wolbachia as a means of 
      biologic control of mosquito-borne infections including DENV and CHIKV has made 
      significant progress. SUMMARY: These studies further our understanding of the 
      evolving DENV and CHIKV epidemiology and potential transmission in nonendemic 
      regions, and can contribute to the assessment of travelers. The new information on 
      immunological responses to these viruses influences the vaccine development. Risk 
      factors for severe disease and new therapeutic options could improve current 
      treatment. Finally, research on Wolbachia holds promise in these two important 
      vector-borne viral infections.

AB  - Dengue is a vector-borne disease recognized as the major arbovirose with four 
      immunologically distant dengue serotypes coexisting in many endemic areas. Several 
      mathematical models have been developed to understand the transmission dynamics of 
      dengue, including the role of cross-reactive antibodies for the four different 
      dengue serotypes. We aimed to review deterministic models of dengue transmission, in 
      order to summarize the evolution of insights for, and provided by, such models, and 
      to identify important characteristics for future model development. We identified 
      relevant publications using PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge, focusing on 
      mathematical deterministic models of dengue transmission. Model assumptions were 
      systematically extracted from each reviewed model structure, and were linked with 
      their underlying epidemiological concepts. After defining common terms in 
      vector-borne disease modelling, we generally categorised fourty-two published models 
      of interest into single serotype and multiserotype models. The multi-serotype models 
      assumed either vector-host or direct host-to-host transmission (ignoring the vector 
      component). For each approach, we discussed the underlying structural and parameter 
      assumptions, threshold behaviour and the projected impact of interventions. In view 
      of the expected availability of dengue vaccines, modelling approaches will 
      increasingly focus on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination 
      options. For this purpose, the level of representation of the vector and host 
      populations seems pivotal. Since vector-host transmission models would be required 
      for projections of combined vaccination and vector control interventions, we 
      advocate their use as most relevant to advice health policy in the future. The 
      limited understanding of the factors which influence dengue transmission as well as 
      limited data availability remain important concerns when applying dengue models to 
      real-world decision problems.

TI  - Animal models of dengue virus infection.
PG  - 62-82
LID - 10.3390/v4010062 [doi]
AB  - The development of animal models of dengue virus (DENV) infection and disease has 
      been challenging, as epidemic DENV does not naturally infect non-human species. 
      Non-human primates (NHPs) can sustain viral replication in relevant cell types and 
      develop a robust immune response, but they do not develop overt disease. In 
      contrast, certain immunodeficient mouse models infected with mouse-adapted DENV 
      strains show signs of severe disease similar to the 'vascular-leak' syndrome seen in 
      severe dengue in humans. Humanized mouse models can sustain DENV replication and 
      show some signs of disease, but further development is needed to validate the immune 
      response. Classically, immunocompetent mice infected with DENV do not manifest 
      disease or else develop paralysis when inoculated intracranially; however, a new 
      model using high doses of DENV has recently been shown to develop hemorrhagic signs 
      after infection. Overall, each model has its advantages and disadvantages and is 
      differentially suited for studies of dengue pathogenesis and immunopathogenesis 
      and/or pre-clinical testing of antiviral drugs and vaccines.

      severe dengue cases has been seen. Severe dengue disease is most often observed in 
      individuals that have pre-existing immunity against heterotypic dengue subtypes and 
      in infants with low levels of maternal dengue antibodies. The generally accepted 
      hypothesis explaining the immunopathogenesis of severe dengue is called 
      antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue infection. Here, circulating antibodies 
      bind to the newly infecting virus but do not neutralize infection. Rather, these 
      antibodies increase the infected cell mass and virus production. Additionally, 
      antiviral responses are diminished allowing massive virus particle production early 
      in infection. The large infected cell mass and the high viral load are prelude for 
      severe disease development. In this review, we discuss what is known about the 
      trafficking of dengue virus in its human host cells, and the signalling pathways 
      activated after virus detection, both in the absence and presence of antibodies 
      against the virus. This review summarizes work that aims to better understand the 
      complex immunopathogenesis of severe dengue disease.

PG  - 259-66
AB  - Conditions that facilitate sustained dengue transmission exist in the United States, 
      and outbreaks have occurred during the past decade in Texas, Hawaii, and Florida. 
      More outbreaks can also be expected in years to come. To combat dengue, medical and 
      public health practitioners in areas with mosquito vectors that are competent to 
      transmit the virus must be aware of the threat of reemergent dengue, and the need 
      for early reporting and control to reduce the impact of dengue outbreaks. 
      Comprehensive dengue control includes human and vector surveillance, vector 
      management programs, and community engagement efforts. Public health, medical, and 
      vector-control communities must collaborate to prevent and control disease spread. 
      Policy makers should understand the role of mosquito abatement and community 
      engagement in the prevention and control of the disease.

TI  - Need for an efficient adult trap for the surveillance of dengue vectors.
PG  - 739-49
AB  - The emergence and re-emergence of arboviral diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti 
      and Ae. albopictus continue to be a major threat in the tropics and subtropics. 
      Associations between currently used indices and dengue transmission have not been 
      proven to be satisfactorily predictive of dengue epidemics. Classical larval indices 
      in dengue surveillance have limited use in assessing transmission risk and are a 
      poor proxy for measuring adult emergence. Besides, collection of larval indices is 
      labour intensive and plagued by difficulties of access particularly in urban 
      settings. The re-emergence of dengue disease in many countries despite lower 
      immature indices has warranted the need for more effective indices in dengue vector 
      surveillance and control. Reliable and highly useful indices could be developed with 
      the help of efficient and appropriate entomological tools. Most current programmes 
      emphasize reduction of immature Ae. aegypti density, but it is of little value 
      because its relation to transmission risk is weak. More attention should be paid to 
      methods directed toward adult rather than immature Ae. aegypti. Collection of 
      sufficient numbers of adult mosquitoes is important to understand disease 
      transmission dynamics and to devise an appropriate control strategy. Even though, 
      use of certain traps such as BG-Sentinel traps has been attempted in monitoring Ae. 
      aegypti population, their utility is limited due to various setbacks which make 
      these insufficient for entomological and epidemiological studies. Thus, there is an 
      urgent need for the development of an ideal trap that could be used for adult vector 
      surveillance. The present review critically analyzes the setbacks in the existing 
      tools of entomological surveillance of dengue vectors and highlights the importance 
      and necessity of more improved, more sensitive and reliable adult trap that could be 
      used for surveillance of dengue vectors.

TI  - Role of microparticles in dengue virus infection and its impact on medical 
      intervention strategies.
PG  - 3-18
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) is one of the most important vector-borne diseases in the world. 
      It causes a disease that manifests as a spectrum of clinical symptoms, including 
      dengue hemorrhagic fever. DV is proficient at diverting the immune system to 
      facilitate transmission through its vector host, Aedes spp. mosquito. Similar to 
      other vector-borne parasites, dengue may also require a second structural form, a 
      virus of alternative morphology (VAM), to complete its life cycle. DV can replicate 
      to high copy numbers in patient plasma, but no classical viral particles can be 
      detected by ultra-structural microscopy analysis. A VAM appearing as a microparticle 
      has been recapitulated with in vitro cell lines Meg01 and K562, close relatives to 
      the cells harboring dengue virus in vivo. VAMs are likely to contribute to the high 
      viremia levels observed in dengue patients. This review discusses the possible 
      existence of a VAM in the DV life cycle.

LID - v4030397 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v4030397 [doi]
AB  - For viruses to productively infect their hosts, they must evade or inhibit important 
      elements of the innate immune system, namely the type I interferon (IFN) response, 
      which negatively influences the subsequent development of antigen-specific adaptive 
      immunity against those viruses. Dengue virus (DENV) can inhibit both type I IFN 
      production and signaling in susceptible human cells, including dendritic cells 
      (DCs). The NS2B3 protease complex of DENV functions as an antagonist of type I IFN 
      production, and its proteolytic activity is necessary for this function. DENV also 
      encodes proteins that antagonize type I IFN signaling, including NS2A, NS4A, NS4B 
      and NS5 by targeting different components of this signaling pathway, such as STATs. 
      Importantly, the ability of the NS5 protein to bind and degrade STAT2 contributes to 
      the limited host tropism of DENV to humans and non-human primates. In this review, 
      we will evaluate the contribution of innate immunity evasion by DENV to the 
      pathogenesis and host tropism of this virus.

TI  - Community participation in the prevention and control of dengue: the patio limpio 
      strategy in Mexico.
PG  - 10-3

AB  - Community participation is vital to prevent and control the spread of dengue in 
      Latin America. Initiatives such as the integrated management strategy for dengue 
      prevention and control (IMS-Dengue) and integrated vector management (IVM) 
      incorporate social mobilisation and behavioural change at the community level as 
      part of a wider strategy to control dengue. These strategies aim to improve the 
      efficacy, cost-effectiveness, environmental impact and sustainability of vector 
      control strategies. Community empowerment is a key aspect of the strategy as it 
      allows the local population to drive eradication of the disease in their 
      environment. Through the patio limpio campaign, the concept of community 
      participation has been employed in Mexico to raise awareness of the consequences of 
      dengue. patio limpio consists of training local people to identify, eliminate, 
      monitor and evaluate vector breeding sites systematically in households under their 
      supervision. A community participation programme in Guerrero State found that 
      approximately 54% were clean and free of breeding sites. Households that were not 
      visited and assessed had a 2·4-times higher risk of developing dengue than those 
      that were. However, after a year, only 30% of trained households had a clean 
      backyard. This emphasises the need for a sustainable process to encourage 
      individuals to maintain efforts in keeping their environment free of dengue.

AB  - Dengue virus (DV) is the most widespread arbovirus, being endemic in over 100 
      countries, and is estimated to cause 50 million infections annually. Viral factors, 
      such as the genetic composition of the virus strain can play a role in determining 
      the virus virulence and subsequent clinical disease severity. Virus vector 
      competence plays an integral role in virus transmission and is a critical factor in 
      determining the severity and impact of DV outbreaks. Host genetic variations in 
      immune-related genes, including the human leukocyte antigen, have also been shown to 
      correlate with clinical disease and thus may play a role in regulating disease 
      severity. The host's immune system, however, appears to be the primary factor in DV 
      pathogenesis with the delicate interplay of innate and acquired immunity playing a 
      crucial role. Although current research of DV pathogenesis has been limited by the 
      lack of an appropriate animal model, the development of DV therapeutics has been a 
      primary focus of research groups around the world. In the past decade advances in 
      both the development of vaccines and anti-virals have increased in dramatically. 
      This review summarises the current understanding of viral, vector and host factors 
      which contribute to dengue virus pathogenesis and how this knowledge is critically 
      important in the development of pharmaceutical interventions.

AB  - Dengue represents a substantial burden in many tropical and sub-tropical regions of 
      the world. We estimated the economic burden of dengue illness in Malaysia. 
      Information about economic burden is needed for setting health policy priorities, 
      but accurate estimation is difficult because of incomplete data. We overcame this 
      limitation by merging multiple data sources to refine our estimates, including an 
      extensive literature review, discussion with experts, review of data from health and 
      surveillance systems, and implementation of a Delphi process. Because Malaysia has a 
      passive surveillance system, the number of dengue cases is under-reported. Using an 
      adjusted estimate of total dengue cases, we estimated an economic burden of dengue 
      illness of US$56 million (Malaysian Ringgit MYR196 million) per year, which is 
      approximately US$2.03 (Malaysian Ringgit 7.14) per capita. The overall economic 
      burden of dengue would be even higher if we included costs associated with dengue 
      prevention and control, dengue surveillance, and long-term sequelae of dengue.

AB  - Since 2001, three autochthonous dengue fever outbreaks have occurred in the United 
      States: in Hawaii (2001); Brownsville, Texas (2005); and southern Florida 
      (2009-2011). We sought to characterize and describe the response to these outbreaks 
      from the perspectives of public health and vector control officials. By conducting a 
      medical literature review through PubMed and news media searches through Google, we 
      identified persons involved in managing each outbreak; 26 persons then participated 
      in qualitative, semistructured interviews. After analyzing the 3 outbreaks, we found 
      the following prominent themes in the response efforts: timely detection of illness; 
      communication of up-to-date, correct information; and development of a rapid 
      response that engages the community. We therefore recommend that public health 
      authorities involve the clinical and laboratory community promptly, provide accurate 
      information, and engage the local community in vector control and case 
      identification and reporting.

AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted infection that poses significant global health 
      risks for travelers and individuals living in the tropics and subtropics. The 
      reported global incidence has increased dramatically in the past century, with 
      dengue now ranking as the most common cause of febrile illness in travelers. While 
      sporadic cases have been reported within the southern United States since 1980, 
      autochthonous outbreaks have now been described in Hawaii, St. Croix (US Virgin 
      Islands), along the Texas-Mexico border, and, most recently, in Key West, Florida. 
      Although many infections are mild or asymptomatic, 5-10% of patients may experience 
      hemorrhagic disease, with shock and even death. Laboratory identification commonly 
      involves serologic and nucleic acid amplification methods. Due to rising incidence 
      worldwide, physicians should be familiar with the clinical manifestations, 
      laboratory diagnosis, and management of this illness.

TI  - Reviewing the development, evidence base, and application of the revised dengue case 
      classification.
PG  - 94-101

AB  - With the example of dengue, an evidence-based approach to prospectively develop a 
      case classification is described, gathering evidence for identifying strength and 
      weaknesses of the existing model, collecting new data describing the disease as it 
      occurs globally, further developing a new model that can be applied in practice and 
      field testing the newly developed model in comparison to the previous model. For 
      each step in this process, the highest available level of evidence has been applied. 
      This process has been initiated by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Special 
      Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and WHO's Department 
      for Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD), developing the following for 
      dengue. Since the early 1970s, dengue has been classified into dengue fever, dengue 
      haemorrhagic fever grades I and II and dengue shock syndrome grades III and IV 
      (DF/DHF/DSS). However, in recent years, a growing number of dengue clinicians have 
      questioned the shortcomings of this scheme. The issues have revolved around the 
      complexity of confirming DHF in clinical practice, misclassifying severe cases as 
      DF, and the emphasis on haemorrhage rather than plasma leakage as the underlying 
      problem in most severe dengue cases. Step 1: A systematic literature review 
      highlighted the shortcomings of the DF/DHF/DSS scheme: (1) difficulties in applying 
      the criteria for DHF/DSS; (2) the tourniquet test has a low sensitivity for 
      distinguishing between DHF and DF; and (3) most DHF criteria had a large variability 
      in frequency of occurrence. Step 2: An analysis of regional and national dengue 
      guidelines and their application in the clinical practice showed a need to 
      re-evaluate and standardize guidelines as the actual ones showed a large variation 
      of definitions, an inconsistent application by medical staff, and a lack of 
      diagnostic facilities necessary for the DHF diagnosis in frontline services. Step 3: 
      A prospective cohort study in seven countries, confirmed the difficulties in 
      applying the DF/DHF/DSS criteria even in tertiary care hospitals, that DF/DHF/DSS do 
      not represent levels of disease severity and that a clear distinction between severe 
      dengue (defined by plasma leakage and/or severe haemorrhage, and/or organ failure) 
      and (non-severe) dengue can be made using highly sensitive and specific criteria. In 
      contrast, the sub-grouping of (non-severe) dengue into two further severity levels 
      was only possible with criteria that gave approximately 70% sensitivity and 
      specificity. Step 4: Three regional expert consensus groups in the Americas and Asia 
      concluded that 'dengue is one disease entity with different clinical presentations 
      and often with unpredictable clinical evolution and outcome' and that, revising the 
      results of Step 3, DF/DHF/DSS is not related to disease severity. Step 5: In a 
      global expert consensus meeting at WHO in Geneva/Switzerland the evidence collected 
      in Steps 1-4 was reviewed and a revised scheme was developed and accepted, 
      distinguishing: dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue; the further 
      field testing and acquisition of further prospective evidence of the revised scheme 
      was recommended. Step 6: In 18 countries, the usefulness and applicability of the 
      revised classification compared to the DF/DHF/DSS scheme were tested showing clear 
      results in favour of the revised classification. Step 7: Studies are under way on 
      the predictive value of warning signs for severe dengue and on criteria for the 
      clinical diagnosis of dengue which will complete the evidence foundation of the 
      revised classification. The analysis has shown that the revised dengue case 
      classification is better able to standardize clinical management, raise awareness 
      about unnecessary interventions, match patient categories with specific treatment 
      instructions, and make the key messages of patient management understandable for all 
      health care staff dealing with dengue patients. Furthermore, the evidence-based 
      approach to develop prospectively the dengue case classification could be a model 
      approach for other disease classifications.

AB  - Dengue fever affects over a 100 million people annually hence is one of the world's 
      most important vector-borne diseases. The transmission area of this disease 
      continues to expand due to many direct and indirect factors linked to urban sprawl, 
      increased travel and global warming. Current preventative measures include mosquito 
      control programs, yet due to the complex nature of the disease and the increased 
      importation risk along with the lack of efficient prophylactic measures, successful 
      disease control and elimination is not realistic in the foreseeable future. 
      Epidemiological models attempt to predict future outbreaks using information on the 
      risk factors of the disease. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims 
      at analyzing the different modeling methods and their outputs in terms of acting as 
      an early warning system. We found that many previous studies have not sufficiently 
      accounted for the spatio-temporal features of the disease in the modeling process. 
      Yet with advances in technology, the ability to incorporate such information as well 
      as the socio-environmental aspect allowed for its use as an early warning system, 
      albeit limited geographically to a local scale.

AB  - Dengue transmission has increased worldwide, particularly in Asia and Latin America 
      since the 1970s, but limited information on the disease is available from the Middle 
      East. Saudi Arabia and Yemen have reported a few epidemics of dengue. Three of the 
      four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1-3) have been reported in the region. Climate 
      conditions in the Middle East are not favourable for the disease vector, but all 
      other risk factors for dengue are potentially increasing. The existence of a large 
      immigrant work force from dengue-endemic countries, increased travel from and to 
      dengue-endemic countries and increased urbanization are expected to increase the 
      likelihood of the emergence of dengue in the Middle East.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that constitutes a growing 
      global threat with the habitat expansion of its vectors Aedes aegyti and A. 
      albopictus and increasing urbanization. With no effective treatment and limited 
      success of vector control, dengue vaccines constitute the best control measure for 
      the foreseeable future. With four interacting dengue serotypes, the development of 
      an effective vaccine has been a challenge. Several dengue vaccine candidates are 
      currently being tested in clinical trials. Before the widespread introduction of a 
      new dengue vaccine, one needs to consider how best to use limited supplies of 
      vaccine given the complex dengue transmission dynamics and the immunological 
      interaction among the four dengue serotypes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We 
      developed an individual-level (including both humans and mosquitoes), stochastic 
      simulation model for dengue transmission and control in a semi-rural area in 
      Thailand. We calibrated the model to dengue serotype-specific infection, illness and 
      hospitalization data from Thailand. Our simulations show that a realistic roll-out 
      plan, starting with young children then covering progressively older individuals in 
      following seasons, could reduce local transmission of dengue to low levels. 
      Simulations indicate that this strategy could avert about 7,700 uncomplicated dengue 
      fever cases and 220 dengue hospitalizations per 100,000 people at risk over a 
      ten-year period. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Vaccination will have an important role 
      in controlling dengue. According to our modeling results, children should be 
      prioritized to receive vaccine, but adults will also need to be vaccinated if one 
      wants to reduce community-wide dengue transmission to low levels.

AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) belongs to the flavivirus family. Each of the four distinct 
      serotypes of this virus is capable of causing human disease, especially in tropical 
      and subtropical areas. The majority of people infected with DENV manifest 
      asymptomatic or dengue fever with flu-like self-limited symptoms. However, a small 
      portion of patients emerge with severe manifestations referred to as dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever, which has a high mortality rate if not treated promptly. The host 
      immune system, which plays important roles throughout the whole process of DENV 
      infection, has been confirmed to have double-edged effects on DENV infection. 
      Recently, much attention has been paid to the genetic heterogeneity of molecules 
      involved in the host immune response to DENV infection. This heterogeneity has been 
      proved to be the determining factor for DENV disease orientation. The present review 
      discusses the primary functions and single nucleotide polymorphisms of some critical 
      molecules in the human DENV immunological defense, especially the polymorphism locus 
      associated with the DENV pathogenesis and disease susceptibility.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the nature and extent of dual dengue and malaria infections 
      in an endemic area through a longitudinal study. METHODS: A prospective study was 
      conducted from August 2005 to December 2010 to document the nature and extent of 
      concurrent dengue and malaria infections in an area in central Kolkata, endemic both 
      for dengue and malaria. RESULTS: Of 2 971 suspected cases of dengue fever, in 605 
      (20.36%) persons dengue infection was detected, of whom 46 (7.60%, 46/605) patients 
      (40 and 6 suffered from secondary and primary dengue fever respectively) were 
      simultaneously suffering from malaria (28 and 18 were infected with Plasmodium vivax 
      (P.vivax) and Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) respectively, such dual 
      infections of dengue and malaria were detected in all the years of the study period, 
      except 2007, indicating intense transmission of both dengue and malaria in the study 
      area, and the phenomenon was not an isolated one, the rate of concomitant infections 
      ranged from 25% in 2009 to 4.9% in 2005. Out of total population surveyed, 1.54% 
      (46/2 971) had concurrent dengue and malaria infection. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      added a new dimension in diagnosis, treatment, epidemiology and control of dengue 
      and malaria. The possible risk of concurrent dengue and malaria infections should 
      always be kept in mind in endemic areas for early diagnosis employing modern 
      technology and prompt and effective treatment to avoid serious complications.

TI  - Dengue infections in non-immune travellers to Thailand.
PG  - 412-7
LID - 10.1017/S0950268812000507 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is the most frequent arboviral disease and is expanding geographically. 
      Dengue is also increasingly being reported in travellers, in particular in 
      travellers to Thailand. However, data to quantify the risk of travellers acquiring 
      dengue when travelling to Thailand are lacking. Using mathematical modelling, we set 
      out to estimate the risk of non-immune persons acquiring dengue when travelling to 
      Thailand. The model is deterministic with stochastic parameters and assumes a 
      Poisson distribution for the mosquitoes' biting rate and a Gamma distribution for 
      the probability of acquiring dengue from an infected mosquito. From the force of 
      infection we calculated the risk of dengue acquisition for travellers to Thailand 
      arriving in a typical year (averaged over a 17-year period) in the high season of 
      transmission. A traveller arriving in the high season of transmission and remaining 
      for 7 days has a risk of acquiring dengue of 0·2% (95% CI 0·16-0·23), whereas the 
      risk for travel of 15 and 30 days' duration is 0·46% (95% CI 0·41-0·50) and 0·81% 
      (95% CI 0·76-0·87), respectively. Our data highlight that the risk of non-immune 
      travellers acquiring dengue in Thailand is substantial. The incidence of 0·81% after 
      a 1-month stay is similar to that reported in prospective seroconversion studies in 
      Israeli travellers to Thailand, highlighting that our models are consistent with 
      actual data. Risk estimates based on mathematical modelling offer more detailed 
      information depending on various travel scenarios, and will help the travel medicine 
      provider give better evidence-based advice for travellers to dengue-endemic 
      countries.

AB  - This review article discusses important infectious illnesses, namely malaria, 
      dengue, and chikungunya, in travelers returning from endemic areas. Malaria and 
      dengue are two of the most common systemic illnesses reported in returning 
      travelers. Because chikungunya is gaining importance, it is also briefly discussed. 
      The clinical significance of these diseases is mainly due to the possibility of 
      sudden deterioration with high mortality in clinically healthy looking patients. The 
      key clinical features, their diagnosis, and treatment algorithms are discussed in 
      detail to help in early diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of such 
      travelers presenting in emergency departments.

AB  - Dengue is a viral disease usually transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Dengue 
      outbreaks in the Americas reported in medical literature and to the Pan American 
      Health Organization are described. The outbreak history from 1600 to 2010 was 
      categorized into four phases: Introduction of dengue in the Americas (1600-1946); 
      Continental plan for the eradication of the Ae. aegypti (1947-1970) marked by a 
      successful eradication of the mosquito in 18 continental countries by 1962; Ae. 
      aegypti reinfestation (1971-1999) caused by the failure of the mosquito eradication 
      program; Increased dispersion of Ae. aegypti and dengue virus circulation 
      (2000-2010) characterized by a marked increase in the number of outbreaks. During 
      2010 > 1.7 million dengue cases were reported, with 50,235 severe cases and 1,185 
      deaths. A dramatic increase in the number of outbreaks has been reported in recent 
      years. Urgent global action is needed to avoid further disease spread.

TI  - Dengue viral infection in children: a perspective.
PG  - 907-12
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2012-301710 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a vector-borne viral infection of global importance. Several pathogenetic 
      mechanisms such as immune enhancement and selection pressure have been proposed and 
      febrile, critical and recovery phases have been identified. A new classification 
      proposed by WHO has recently been introduced where definitions have been changed to 
      'probable dengue', 'dengue with warning signs' and 'severe dengue'. The majority of 
      dengue viral infections are self-limiting, but complications have high morbidity and 
      mortality. The diagnosis of dengue viral infection is essentially clinical, although 
      confirmation requires laboratory tests including serology, NS1 antigen detection, 
      PCR and viral cultures. There are no specific anti-dengue drugs and treatment is 
      basically supportive and consists of early recognition of complications and 
      appropriate fluid therapy. A number of candidate vaccines are under development.

AB  - Dengue fever is an important public health problem in Jamaica and has various 
      serious manifestations, which if not identified and treated at the appropriate time 
      can lead to dire consequences. Bacterial co-infections have been seen in clinical 
      practice but may be thought of as simply coincidental. This review highlights the 
      importance of bacteria in exacerbating dengue infections and the importance of 
      looking for co-infection in patients with certain clinical manifestations. It also 
      provides the reader with a scientific understanding of the immune pathogenesis of 
      dengue and bacterial co-infections.

AB  - Dengue is characterized by biphasic fever, myalgia or arthralgia, rash, leukopenia, 
      and lymphadenopathy. It is self-limiting, and dengue-associated haemophagocytic 
      lymphohistiocytosis has been reported in fewer than 20 children worldwide. We report 
      the case of a 4-y-old boy with dengue who continued to have fever for 30 days, with 
      hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Bone marrow examination showed 
      haemophagocytes. The child was treated with steroids, instead etoposide and oral 
      cyclosporine.

PG  - 1072-6
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0723 [doi]
AB  - We analyzed surveillance data of a dengue outbreak (2010) reported to the Hadramout 
      Health Office (Yemen) and retrospectively analyzed dengue-related epidemiological 
      and entomological events reported in Hadramout from 2005 to 2009. A total of 630 
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) -confirmed dengue cases of 982 febrile cases was reported 
      during the period from February to June of 2010; 12 cases died, giving case fatality 
      a rate of 1.9%. Among febrile cases, the highest proportion of dengue cases (37.3%) 
      was reported in the 15- to 24-year-old age group. The overall attack rate was 
      0.89/1,000. The average number of cases reported by month over the preceding 5-year 
      period compared with the 2010 data is consistent with endemicity of dengue in the 
      region and supports epidemic designation for the dengue activity in 2010. 
      Recognition of endemic dengue transmission and potential for substantial dengue 
      epidemics highlight the need for consistent laboratory-based surveillance that can 
      support prevention and control activities accordingly.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dengue is the most important arthropod-borne viral disease in the world; 
      it can be life-threatening because of liver involvement. Aim Determining liver 
      involvement frequency and severity in dengue-infected children. METHODS: This was a 
      descriptive case series study which involved studying 108 dengue-infected children 
      aged less than 13 years old whose infection had been confirmed by the detection of 
      dengue-specific IgM and NS1 in plasma. Clinical and biochemical parameters were used 
      for evaluating liver involvement, including transaminases and albumin. Hepatitis A 
      and leptospira infection were also evaluated by using ELISA to detect 
      pathogen-specific IgM in plasma during acute and convalescence phases. The study was 
      carried out at a teaching hospital in Neiva from June 2009 to May 2010. RESULTS: 
      Ninety-eight of the aforementioned cases were clinically classified as dengue with 
      warning signs (DWS) and 10 as severe dengue (SD). Two out of three DWS patients and 
      all SD patients had some degree of liver involvement, shown clinically and 
      biochemically. Regardless of the clinical classification, hepatomegaly was the main 
      clinical sign of liver involvement and was present in 85% of all the children in the 
      study. It is worth noting that 5 patients had probable dengue and leptospirosis 
      co-infection, this being the first instance of this in Colombia. None of the cases 
      analyzed here had acute hepatitis A. CONCLUSIONS: Liver compromise should be 
      considered in confirmed cases of dengue as shown in this series of children. 
      Leptospirosis must be considered as differential diagnosis and also as causing 
      co-infection in a febrile child.

TI  - Dengue in western Terai region of Nepal.
PG  - 152-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue Fever (DF) is an emerging mosquito-borne disease. It is a nagging 
      public health problem in the low lands of Terai, expanding to new areas of Nepal in 
      recent years. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine 
      anti-Dengue IgM positive rate in Mahendranagar, Dhangadi and Dang between August 
      2008 and November 2009. Serum samples were collected from 283 patients visiting 
      hospitals with history of fever, headache and suspected DF. The samples were 
      examined by ELISA. RESULTS: The anti-Dengue IgM positivity was found to be 9.8 %. 
      The positive rate was highest in Mahendranagar (13.3 %) followed by Dhangadi (9.8 %) 
      (P<0.05). The Dengue positive cases were higher in female (10.9 %) than males (9.0 
      %). The positivity was higher in Ethnic group Brahman/Chherti (13.1%) as compared to 
      Janajati (5.6 %). The highest positive cases (10.7 %) were from age group above 50 
      years. The highest numbers of Dengue positive cases were observed in occupation 
      group of agriculture (18.2 %) (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Dengue has substantial 
      expansion in Western and Far Western Terai region of Nepal which was limited to the 
      middle Terai region in the past and mostly infects older people.

LID - e1614
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence and severity of dengue in Latin America has increased 
      substantially in recent decades and data from Puerto Rico suggests an increase in 
      severe cases. Successful clinical management of severe dengue requires early 
      recognition and supportive care. METHODS: Fatal cases were identified among 
      suspected dengue cases reported to two disease surveillance systems and from death 
      certificates. To be included, fatal cases had to have specimen submitted for dengue 
      diagnostic testing including nucleic acid amplification for dengue virus (DENV) in 
      serum or tissue, immunohistochemical testing of tissue, and immunoassay detection of 
      anti-DENV IgM from serum. Medical records from laboratory-positive dengue fatal 
      case-patients were reviewed to identify possible determinants for death. RESULTS: 
      Among 10,576 reported dengue cases, 40 suspect fatal cases were identified, of which 
      11 were laboratory-positive, 14 were laboratory-negative, and 15 
      laboratory-indeterminate. The median age of laboratory-positive case-patients was 26 
      years (range 5 months to 78 years), including five children aged < 15 years; 7 
      sought medical care at least once prior to hospital admission, 9 were admitted to 
      hospital and 2 died upon arrival. The nine hospitalized case-patients stayed a mean 
      of 15 hours (range: 3-48 hours) in the emergency department (ED) before inpatient 
      admission. Five of the nine case-patients received intravenous methylprednisolone 
      and four received non-isotonic saline while in shock. Eight case-patients died in 
      the hospital; five had their terminal event on the inpatient ward and six died 
      during a weekend. Dengue was listed on the death certificate in only 5 instances. 
      CONCLUSIONS: During a dengue epidemic in an endemic area, none of the 11 
      laboratory-positive case-patients who died were managed according to current WHO 
      Guidelines. Management issues identified in this case-series included failure to 
      recognize warning signs for severe dengue and shock, prolonged ED stays, and 
      infrequent patient monitoring.

AB  - The use of vector surveillance tools for preventing dengue disease requires fine 
      assessment of risk, in order to improve vector control activities. Nevertheless, the 
      thresholds between vector detection and dengue fever occurrence are currently not 
      well established. In Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais, Brazil), dengue has been endemic 
      for several years. From January 2007 to June 2008, the dengue vector Aedes 
      (Stegomyia) aegypti was monitored by ovitrap, the sticky-trap MosquiTRAP™ and larval 
      surveys in an study area in Belo Horizonte. Using a space-time scan for clusters 
      detection implemented in SaTScan software, the vector presence recorded by the 
      different monitoring methods was evaluated. Clusters of vectors and dengue fever 
      were detected. It was verified that ovitrap and MosquiTRAP vector detection methods 
      predicted dengue occurrence better than larval survey, both spatially and 
      temporally. MosquiTRAP and ovitrap presented similar results of space-time 
      intersections to dengue fever clusters. Nevertheless ovitrap clusters presented 
      longer duration periods than MosquiTRAP ones, less acuratelly signalizing the dengue 
      risk areas, since the detection of vector clusters during most of the study period 
      was not necessarily correlated to dengue fever occurrence. It was verified that 
      ovitrap clusters occurred more than 200 days (values ranged from 97.0±35.35 to 
      283.0±168.4 days) before dengue fever clusters, whereas MosquiTRAP clusters preceded 
      dengue fever clusters by approximately 80 days (values ranged from 65.5±58.7 to 
      94.0±14. 3 days), the former showing to be more temporally precise. Thus, in the 
      present cluster analysis study MosquiTRAP presented superior results for signaling 
      dengue transmission risks both geographically and temporally. Since early detection 
      is crucial for planning and deploying effective preventions, MosquiTRAP showed to be 
      a reliable tool and this method provides groundwork for the development of even more 
      precise tools.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: An accurate early warning system to predict impending epidemics 
      enhances the effectiveness of preventive measures against dengue fever. The aim of 
      this study was to develop and validate a forecasting model that could predict dengue 
      cases and provide timely early warning in Singapore. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: We developed a time series Poisson multivariate regression model using 
      weekly mean temperature and cumulative rainfall over the period 2000-2010. Weather 
      data were modeled using piecewise linear spline functions. We analyzed various lag 
      times between dengue and weather variables to identify the optimal dengue 
      forecasting period. Autoregression, seasonality and trend were considered in the 
      model. We validated the model by forecasting dengue cases for week 1 of 2011 up to 
      week 16 of 2012 using weather data alone. Model selection and validation were based 
      on Akaike's Information Criterion, standardized Root Mean Square Error, and 
      residuals diagnoses. A Receiver Operating Characteristics curve was used to analyze 
      the sensitivity of the forecast of epidemics. The optimal period for dengue forecast 
      was 16 weeks. Our model forecasted correctly with errors of 0.3 and 0.32 of the 
      standard deviation of reported cases during the model training and validation 
      periods, respectively. It was sensitive enough to distinguish between outbreak and 
      non-outbreak to a 96% (CI = 93-98%) in 2004-2010 and 98% (CI = 95%-100%) in 2011. 
      The model predicted the outbreak in 2011 accurately with less than 3% possibility of 
      false alarm. SIGNIFICANCE: We have developed a weather-based dengue forecasting 
      model that allows warning 16 weeks in advance of dengue epidemics with high 
      sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate that models using temperature and 
      rainfall could be simple, precise, and low cost tools for dengue forecasting which 
      could be used to enhance decision making on the timing, scale of vector control 
      operations, and utilization of limited resources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A dengue early warning system aims to prevent a dengue outbreak by 
      providing an accurate prediction of a rise in dengue cases and sufficient time to 
      allow timely decisions and preventive measures to be taken by local authorities. 
      This study seeks to identify the optimal lead time for warning of dengue cases in 
      Singapore given the duration required by a local authority to curb an outbreak. 
      METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: We developed a Poisson regression model to analyze 
      relative risks of dengue cases as functions of weekly mean temperature and 
      cumulative rainfall with lag times of 1-5 months using spline functions. We examined 
      the duration of vector control and cluster management in dengue clusters > = 10 
      cases from 2000 to 2010 and used the information as an indicative window of the time 
      required to mitigate an outbreak. Finally, we assessed the gap between forecast and 
      successful control to determine the optimal timing for issuing an early warning in 
      the study area. Our findings show that increasing weekly mean temperature and 
      cumulative rainfall precede risks of increasing dengue cases by 4-20 and 8-20 weeks, 
      respectively. These lag times provided a forecast window of 1-5 months based on the 
      observed weather data. Based on previous vector control operations, the time needed 
      to curb dengue outbreaks ranged from 1-3 months with a median duration of 2 months. 
      Thus, a dengue early warning forecast given 3 months ahead of the onset of a 
      probable epidemic would give local authorities sufficient time to mitigate an 
      outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal timing of a dengue forecast increases the functional 
      value of an early warning system and enhances cost-effectiveness of vector control 
      operations in response to forecasted risks. We emphasize the importance of 
      considering the forecast-mitigation gaps in respective study areas when developing a 
      dengue forecasting model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue infection is one of the most important mosquito-borne diseases. 
      More data regarding the disease burden and the prevalence of each clinical spectrum 
      among symptomatic infections and the clinical manifestations are needed. This study 
      aims to describe the incidence and clinical manifestations of symptomatic dengue 
      infection in Thai children during 2006 through 2008. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a 
      school-based prospective open cohort study with a 9,448 person-year follow-up in 
      children aged 3-14 years. Active surveillance for febrile illnesses was done in the 
      studied subjects. Subjects who had febrile illness were asked to visit the study 
      hospital for clinical and laboratory evaluation, treatment, and serological tests 
      for dengue infection. The clinical data from medical records, diary cards, and data 
      collection forms were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Dengue infections were the 
      causes of 12.1% of febrile illnesses attending the hospital, including 
      undifferentiated fever (UF) (49.8%), dengue fever (DF) (39.3%) and dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (10.9%). Headache, anorexia, nausea/vomiting and myalgia 
      were common symptoms occurring in more than half of the patients. The more severe 
      dengue spectrum (i.e., DHF) had higher temperature, higher prevalence of 
      nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, diarrhea, petechiae, hepatomegaly and lower 
      platelet count. DHF cases also had significantly higher prevalence of anorexia, 
      nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain during day 3-6 and diarrhea during day 4-6 of 
      illness. The absence of nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, petechiae, 
      hepatomegaly and positive tourniquet test may predict non-DHF. CONCLUSION: Among 
      symptomatic dengue infection, UF is most common followed by DF and DHF. Some 
      clinical manifestations may be useful to predict the more severe disease (i.e., 
      DHF). This study presents additional information in the clinical spectra of 
      symptomatic dengue infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is commonly associated with myalgia, but there is paucity of 
      studies on the frequency, severity, and basis of muscle involvement. The aim of this 
      study was to document the clinical, electromyographic, and histological changes in 
      dengue-associated muscle dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seropositive dengue 
      patients admitted to the neurology ward during 2010 were enrolled in this study. 
      Detailed medical history, including bleeding diathesis and organomegaly, were noted. 
      Muscle power on a 0-5 scale, muscle tone, reflex, sensations and coordination were 
      tested. Blood counts, hemoglobin, and serum chemistry, including creatine kinase 
      (CK) evaluations, were carried out. Concentric needle electromyography (EMG) and 
      muscle biopsy were performed when clinical conditions were suitable. RESULTS: The 
      study cohort comprised 39 patients with dengue, with a median age of 28 years. Of 
      these, 31 patients showed evidence of muscle involvement-16 with clinical and 15 
      with subclinical muscle involvement. Eight of these patients had severe weakness and 
      five had hyporeflexia. Thrombocytopenia was present in 26 patients, elevated serum 
      creatinine in three patients and liver dysfunction in 31 patients. The median CK 
      level was 837 (range 194-3,832) U/L. The EMG revealed polyphasic normal to short 
      duration motor unit potentials, but spontaneous activity was absent. Muscle biopsy 
      in three patients revealed interstitial hemorrhage with occasional necrosis and 
      myophagocytosis. There was no vasculitis, but subtle inflammatory changes were 
      present in one patient. The severity of muscle weakness correlated with the platelet 
      count and CK level. All patients improved by 15 days of treatment initiation. 
      CONCLUSION: Dengue commonly results in benign and self-limiting transient muscle 
      dysfunction.

TI  - Dermatological manifestations of dengue fever.
PG  - 52-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Each year dengue related infections are rising in tropical countries. 
      There is not enough data available on dermatological manifestations of dengue fever. 
      This study was conducted to investigate prevalence and type of dermatological 
      manifestations of dengue fever (DF). Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF), and Dengue 
      Shock Syndrome (DSS). METHODS: A Prospective study was contacted in Department of 
      Medicine, Shaikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, from 3rd Oct to 20th Nov 2010. Specific 
      serological tests for DF were done in all 60 patients admitted with suspected 
      diagnosis of DF, DHF or DSS. Forty-eight confirmed cases were evaluated for age, 
      gender, mucocutaneous features and outcome of the disease. RESULTS: Forty-eight out 
      of 60 patients had positive serology for dengue fever. Male to female ratio was 
      1.09:1. Their ages ranged 5-68 years with a mean of 31.5 +/- 15.2. DF, DHF and DSS 
      were found in 71%, 19% and 10% respectively. Common dermatological presentations 
      were oral mucous membrane congestion (66.67%), generalised morbiliform rash (64.58%) 
      and eye congestion (64.58%). Purpuric spots along with mucous membrane congestion, 
      generalised morbiliform rash and eyes congestion was observed in 20.83%, 12.5% and 
      6.25% patients respectively. All except one patient improved clinically. One patient 
      died of respiratory distress and haemorrhage on second day of admission. CONCLUSION: 
      Dermatological features are significantly noticeable in dengue fever patients. These 
      may help us in early diagnosis and better management of patients.

TI  - Economic cost of dengue in Puerto Rico.
PG  - 745-752
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0784 [doi]
AB  - Dengue, endemic in Puerto Rico, reached a record high in 2010. To inform policy 
      makers, we derived annual economic cost. We assessed direct and indirect costs of 
      hospitalized and ambulatory dengue illness in 2010 dollars through surveillance data 
      and interviews with 100 laboratory-confirmed dengue patients treated in 2008-2010. 
      We corrected for underreporting by using setting-specific expansion factors. Work 
      absenteeism because of a dengue episode exceeded the absenteeism for an episode of 
      influenza or acute otitis media. From 2002 to 2010, the aggregate annual cost of 
      dengue illness averaged $38.7 million, of which 70% was for adults (age 15+ years). 
      Hospitalized patients accounted for 63% of the cost of dengue illness, and fatal 
      cases represented an additional 17%. Households funded 48% of dengue illness cost, 
      the government funded 24%, insurance funded 22%, and employers funded 7%. Including 
      dengue surveillance and vector control activities, the overall annual cost of dengue 
      was $46.45 million ($12.47 per capita).

TI  - Dengue virus surveillance in Singapore reveals high viral diversity through multiple 
      introductions and in situ evolution.
PG  - 77-85
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2011.10.012 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever, a vector-borne disease, has caused tremendous burden to countries in 
      the tropics and sub tropics. Over the past 20 years, dengue epidemics have become 
      more widespread, severe and frequent. This study aims to understand the dynamics of 
      dengue viruses in cosmopolitan Singapore. Envelope protein gene sequences of all 
      four dengue serotypes (DENV-1-DENV-4) obtained from human sera in Singapore 
      (2008-2010) revealed that constant viral introductions and in situ evolution 
      contribute to viral diversity in Singapore and play important roles in shaping the 
      epidemiology of dengue in the island state. The diversity of dengue viruses reported 
      here could be a reflection of the on-going dengue situation in the region given 
      Singapore's location in a dengue hyperendemic region and its role as the regional 
      hub for travels and trade. Though cosmopolitan genotype of DENV-2 has remained as 
      the predominant strain circulating in Singapore, we uncovered evidence of in situ 
      evolution which could possibly result in viruses with improved fitness. While we 
      have previously shown that a switch in the predominant dengue serotype could serve 
      as a warning for an impending outbreak, our current data shows that a replacement of 
      a predominant viral clade, even in the absence of a switch in predominant serotype, 
      could signal a possible increase in dengue transmission. The circulating dengue 
      viruses in Singapore are highly diverse, a situation which could offer ample 
      opportunities for selection of strains of higher fitness, thus increasing the risk 
      of outbreaks despite a low Aedes population.

TI  - Construction of the discourse on dengue fever in the media.
PG  - 63-74
LID - S1415-790X2012000100006 [pii]
AB  - The aim of this paper was to understand how the media in the state of Pernambuco 
      portrays dengue fever, a disease that is affecting more and more Brazilians. Taking 
      the explosive epidemic of 2002 as the starting point, we tried to understand the 
      effects of meaning produced by the press in a comparative discourse strategy 
      analysis used in 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. We selected 291 articles and notes 
      published in the Jornal do Commercio (Recife-Brazil), on the situation of this viral 
      disease in the state of Pernambuco in the four years. We also analysed dengue fever 
      surveillance reports published by the health department of Pernambuco. To complement 
      discourse analysis, we proposed the construction of a medialogy diagram, a graphic 
      representation that tries to establish a relationship between newspaper texts and 
      number cases of dengue reported. Results indicate that media coverage generally 
      followed the development of dengue fever cases, with more news published during the 
      epidemic periods and showing the appeal of the illness as a mass media phenomenon 
      despite its risk to the Brazilian people.

TI  - Dengue outbreak in Delhi in 2009: study of laboratory and clinical parameters.
PG  - 163-8
AB  - Dengue infection is endemic in India with frequent epidemics of Dengue Fever/Dengue 
      Hemorrhagic Fever. The outbreaks vary in the commonest serotype in circulation 
      during that period, predominant laboratory findings and clinical manifestations. 
      This study was carried during the outbreak of dengue in Delhi in 2009. Clinical 
      assessment and laboratory investigations were performed and severity of the disease 
      with clinical, haematological parameters and serotypes were correlated. Of 107 
      patients included in the study, 64 (59.8%) were positive by ELISA. These 64 patients 
      were tested by RT-PCR and 7 were found to be positive. DEN-2 and DEN-4 serotypes 
      were isolated. There was a decreasing trend in mean age of patients with severity of 
      infection. The outbreak was milder as compared to earlier ones in regards of number 
      of cases presenting with clinical manifestations of bleeding. A considerable number 
      of patients presented with unusual findings, namely, ascites, pleural effusion, 
      myocarditis, cholecystitis and pancreatitis. There was no statistically significant 
      difference either in platelet count between various groups or comparison of bleeding 
      with severity of thrombocytopenia. This study provides an insight into the 
      clinico-laboratory findings of the outbreak of dengue in 2009.

AB  - The prevalence of dengue around the world makes it critical to develop a simple 
      diagnostic device that can be easily handled by end users and provides fast results. 
      In this paper, we described the use of a small and thin piece of alumina membrane, 
      60 μm thick and 13 mm in diameter as the sensing platform for the detection of 
      dengue infection. The electrochemical setup is simplified by using the membrane as 
      both the working and the counter electrode. This is achieved by coating both sides 
      of the membrane with a submicron layer of platinum. Electrochemical impedance 
      spectroscopy was utilized for the characterization of the immunosensor as well as 
      the acquisition of data. The change in the pore resistance of the membrane displayed 
      a good correlation with the concentration of the dengue 2 and dengue 3 viruses in 
      plaque forming unit (PFU mL⁻¹), giving detection limit of 0.230 PFU mL⁻¹ and 0.710 
      PFU mL⁻¹ respectively. This thin piece of membrane sensor, coupled with the simple 
      electrochemical setup, fast detection time of 40 min and high sensitivity, showed 
      potential to be developed into a disposable point-of-care diagnostic tool for 
      clinical uses.

AB  - Kaohsiung City, a modern metropolis of 1.5 million persons, has been the focus of 
      dengue virus activity in Taiwan for several decades. The aim of this study was to 
      provide a temporal and spatial description of dengue virus epidemiology in Kaohsiung 
      City by using data for all laboratory-confirmed dengue cases during 2003-2009. We 
      investigated age- and sex-dependent incidence rates and the spatiotemporal patterns 
      of all cases confirmed through passive or active surveillance. Elderly persons were 
      at particularly high risk for dengue virus-related sickness and death. Of all 
      confirmed cases, ≈75% were detected through passive surveillance activities; 
      case-patients detected through active surveillance included immediate family 
      members, neighbors, and colleagues of confirmed case-patients. Changing patterns of 
      case clustering could be due to the effect of unmeasured environmental and 
      demographic factors.

AB  - Dengue virus infection is an emerging global threat caused by Arbovirus, a virus 
      from Flaviridiae family, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes 
      albopictus. Renal transplant recipients who live in the endemic zones of dengue 
      infection or who travel to an endemic zone could be at risk of this infection. 
      Despite multiple epidemics and a high case fatality rate in the Southeast Asian 
      region, only a few cases of dengue infection in renal transplant recipients have 
      been reported. Here, we report a case series of 8 dengue viral infection in renal 
      transplant recipients. Of the 8 patients, 3 developed dengue hemorrhagic shock 
      syndrome and died.

AB  - Dengue, a neglected tropical disease that is reemerging around the world, became a 
      nationally notifiable disease in the United States in 2009. Travel to tropical and 
      subtropical areas in the developing world poses the greatest risk of infection for 
      US residents, and an increase in travel to these areas makes this infection more 
      likely to be seen by primary care physicians in their practices.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the antibody prevalence against dengue in the municipality of 
      Jundiaí, São Paulo, Brazil, due to the low number of official confirmed 
      autochthonous cases. METHODS: A serological study on dengue infection was conducted 
      during January 2010 and previous reports on dengue and entomological surveillance 
      during that period were reviewed. RESULTS: A prevalence of 7.8% IgG positive 
      (68:876) was found. Furthermore, based on the detection of IgM antibodies in five 
      samples, it was observed that the incidence of dengue in the city at the time of the 
      survey contrasts with the absence of notifications by local health authorities over 
      the same period of time. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the discrepancies 
      between the actual and the detected number of dengue infections, possibly due to 
      significant numbers of asymptomatic infections aggravated by difficulties with 
      dengue clinical diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue has emerged as the most important vector-borne viral disease in 
      tropical areas. Evaluations of the burden and severity of dengue disease have been 
      hindered by the frequent lack of laboratory confirmation and strong selection bias 
      toward more severe cases. METHODOLOGY: A multinational, prospective clinical study 
      was carried out in South-East Asia (SEA) and Latin America (LA), to ascertain the 
      proportion of inapparent dengue infections in households of febrile dengue cases, 
      and to compare clinical data and biological markers from subjects with various 
      dengue disease patterns. Dengue infection was laboratory-confirmed during the acute 
      phase, by virus isolation and detection of the genome. The four participating 
      reference laboratories used standardized methods. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 215 
      febrile dengue subjects-114 in SEA and 101 in LA-28 (13.0%) were diagnosed with 
      severe dengue (from SEA only) using the WHO definition. Household investigations 
      were carried out for 177 febrile subjects. Among household members at the time of 
      the first home visit, 39 acute dengue infections were detected of which 29 were 
      inapparent. A further 62 dengue cases were classified at early convalescent phase. 
      Therefore, 101 dengue infections were found among the 408 household members. Adding 
      these together with the 177 Dengue Index Cases, the overall proportion of dengue 
      infections among the study participants was estimated at 47.5% (278/585; 95% CI 
      43.5-51.6). Lymphocyte counts and detection of the NS1 antigen differed 
      significantly between inapparent and symptomatic dengue subjects; among inapparent 
      cases lymphocyte counts were normal and only 20% were positive for NS1 antigen. 
      Primary dengue infection and a specific dengue virus serotype were not associated 
      with symptomatic dengue infection. CONCLUSION: Household investigation demonstrated 
      a high proportion of household members positive for dengue infection, including a 
      number of inapparent cases, the frequency of which was higher in SEA than in LA.

TI  - A local outbreak of dengue caused by an imported case in Dongguan China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue, a mosquito-borne febrile viral disease, is found in tropical and 
      sub-tropical regions around the world. Since the first occurrence of dengue was 
      confirmed in Guangdong, China in 1978, dengue outbreaks have been reported 
      sequentially in different provinces in South China transmitted by peridomestic Ae. 
      albopictus mosquitoes, diplaying Ae. aegypti, a fully domestic vector that transmits 
      dengue worldwide. Rapid and uncontrolled urbanization is a characteristic change in 
      developing countries, which impacts greatly on vector habitat, human lifestyle and 
      transmission dynamics on dengue epidemics. In September 2010, an outbreak of dengue 
      was detected in Dongguan, a city in Guangdong province characterized by its fast 
      urbanization. An investigation was initiated to identify the cause, to describe the 
      epidemical characteristics of the outbreak, and to implement control measures to 
      stop the outbreak. This is the first report of dengue outbreak in Dongguan, even 
      though dengue cases were documented before in this city. METHODS: Epidemiological 
      data were obtained from local Center of Disease Control and prevention (CDC). 
      Laboratory tests such as real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction 
      (RT-PCR), the virus cDNA sequencing, and Enzyme-Linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
      were employed to identify the virus infection and molecular phylogenetic analysis 
      was performed with MEGA5. The febrile cases were reported every day by the fever 
      surveillance system. Vector control measures including insecticidal fogging and 
      elimination of habitats of Ae. albopictus were used to control the dengue outbreak. 
      RESULTS: The epidemiological studies results showed that this dengue outbreak was 
      initiated by an imported case from Southeast Asia. The outbreak was characterized by 
      31 cases reported with an attack rate of 50.63 out of a population of 100,000. Ae. 
      albopictus was the only vector species responsible for the outbreak. The virus cDNA 
      sequencing analysis showed that the virus responsible for the outbreak was Dengue 
      Virus serotype-1 (DENV-1). CONCLUSIONS: Several characterized points of urbanization 
      contributed to this outbreak of dengue in Dongguan: the residents are highly 
      concentrated; the residents' life habits helped to form the habitats of Ae. 
      albopictus and contributed to the high Breteau Index; the self-constructed houses 
      lacks of mosquito prevention facilities. This report has reaffirmed the importance 
      of a surveillance system for infectious diseases control and aroused the awareness 
      of an imported case causing the epidemic of an infectious disease in urbanized 
      region.

AB  - Drugs offer a complementary approach to vaccines for preventing the progression of 
      symptoms and onset of the severe manifestations of dengue. Despite the rapid 
      maturation of the research and development infrastructure for dengue drugs and the 
      increasing frequency of dengue inhibitors reported in the scientific literature, the 
      potential size of the market for dengue drugs has not been articulated. In the 
      present work, extrapolating from publicly available information, we explored the 
      economic burden attributable to dengue, the impact of dengue vaccines on clinical 
      case loads, a possible alternative to tiered pricing for products for neglected 
      diseases, and defined the maximum potential market for a dengue drug. Our 
      projections suggest that in 2006, the annual global burden of dengue was US 
      $1.7billion. Our proposed alternative to existing tiered pricing structures is that 
      during a temporary period of market exclusivity, individual countries would pay 50% 
      of the per-case equivalent of economic costs saved through the use of a dengue drug. 
      This would yield prices per case of US $13-$239 depending on drug effectiveness and 
      cost of medical and indirect costs and lost productivity in different countries. 
      Assuming that such a pricing scheme was embraced, the maximum potential market for a 
      dengue drug or drugs that on average reduced 40% of economic costs might be as high 
      as US $338million annually. Our simulations suggest that dengue vaccines will begin 
      to reduce the clinical case load of dengue in 2022, but that the number of cases 
      will not decrease below 2006 levels and the proportion vaccinated will remain well 
      below that required for the onset of herd immunity during the period of market 
      exclusivity after the licensure of the first wave of dengue drugs.

AB  - A 24 year-old Malay lady presented with high grade fever, myalgia, generalized 
      rashes, severe headache and was positive for dengue serology test. Her lowest 
      platelet count was 45 × 10(9) cells/L. She complained of sudden onset of 
      painlessness, profound loss of vision bilaterally 7 days after the onset of fever. 
      On examination, her right eye best corrected vision was 6/30 and left eye was 6/120. 
      Her anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Funduscopy revealed there were 
      multiple retinal haemorrhages found at posterior pole of both fundi and elevation at 
      fovea area with subretinal fluid. Systemic examination revealed normal findings 
      except for residual petechial rashes. She was managed conservatively. Her vision 
      improved tremendously after 2 months. The retinal hemorrhages and foveal elevation 
      showed sign of resolving. Ocular manifestations following dengue fever is rare. 
      However, bilateral visual loss can occur if both fovea are involved.

TI  - Is dengue and malaria co-infection more severe than single infections? A 
      retrospective matched-pair study in French Guiana.
PG  - 142
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue and malaria are two major arthropod-borne infections in tropical 
      areas, but dual infections were only described for the first time in 2005. Reports 
      of these concomitant infections are scarce and there is no evidence of more severe 
      clinical and biological pictures than single infections. METHODS: To compare 
      co-infections to dengue alone and malaria alone, a retrospective matched-pair study 
      was conducted between 2004 and 2010 among patients admitted in the emergency 
      department of Cayenne hospital, French Guiana. RESULTS: 104 dengue and malaria 
      co-infection cases were identified during the study period and 208 individuals were 
      matched in two comparison groups: dengue alone and malaria alone. In bivariate 
      analysis, co-infection clinical picture was more severe than separated infections, 
      in particular using the severe malaria WHO criteria. In multivariate analysis, 
      independent factors associated with co-infection versus dengue were: masculine 
      gender, CRP level > 50 mg/L, thrombocytopaenia < 50 109/L, and low haematocrit <36% 
      and independent factors significantly associated with co-infections versus malaria 
      were red cells transfusion, low haematocrit < 36%, thrombocytopaenia < 50 109/L and 
      low Plasmodium parasitic load < 0.001%. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, dengue 
      and malaria co-infection clinical picture seems to be more severe than single 
      infections in French Guiana, with a greater risk of deep thrombocytopaenia and 
      anaemia.

PG  - 309-14
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2011.12.011 [doi]
AB  - Evolutionary studies on dengue virus have frequently focused on intra-serotype 
      diversity or on specific epidemics. In this study, we compiled a comprehensive data 
      set of the envelope gene of dengue virus serotypes and conducted an extensive 
      comparative study of evolutionary molecular epidemiology. We found that substitution 
      rates are homogeneous among dengue serotypes, although their population dynamics 
      have differed over the past few years as inferred by Bayesian coalescent methods. On 
      a global scale, DENV-2 is the serotype with the highest effective population size. 
      The genealogies also showed geographical structure within the serotypes. Finally, we 
      also explored the causes of dengue virus serotype diversification by investigating 
      the plausibility that it was driven by adaptive changes. Our results suggest that 
      the envelope gene is under significant purifying selection and the hypothesis that 
      dengue virus serotype diversification was the result of stochastic events cannot be 
      ruled out.

TI  - Clinical profile of dengue infection at a teaching hospital in North India.
PG  - 551-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dengue viral infections are among the most important mosquito-borne 
      diseases of the Indian subcontinent and have become a major global public health 
      concern. Spread of disease has led to increased recognition of atypical 
      manifestations apart from the classical clinical features of dengue infection. 
      METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study of admitted patients suspected to have dengue 
      infection was conducted during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons in the year 
      2010. Patients who had serological confirmation of dengue infection were classified 
      according to World Health Organization definitions of dengue fever and dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever. Clinical and biochemical parameters were compared between the two 
      groups. RESULTS: Out of 356 patients with suspected dengue fever enrolled in the 
      study, 138 (39%) had serologically confirmed dengue infection. Eighty (58%) patients 
      were males and 58 (42%) were females. Ninety-six (70%) patients had classical dengue 
      fever while 42 (30%) had dengue hemorrhagic fever. The most common symptoms were 
      headache (105, 76%), abdominal pain (87, 63%), vomiting (80, 58%), rash (36, 26%), 
      and cutaneous hypersensitivity (22, 16%). Hemorrhagic manifestations were present in 
      55 (40%) patients. Atypical manifestations were recorded. Notably, 14% of patients 
      had neurological involvement and 4% had acute hepatic failure. Overall mortality was 
      6% and all fatal cases were due to multi-organ failure. CONCLUSION: Dengue infection 
      poses a huge burden to the health-care system; its spectrum ranges from mild 
      self-limiting illness to severe fatal disease. It can have varied and multi-systemic 
      manifestations which can go unrecognized. Clinicians should have a high index of 
      suspicion for atypical manifestations.

AB  - Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are important diseases worldwide. Although 
      antibody-dependent enhancement of infection has been proposed as a mechanism for 
      increased disease severity, enhancing antibodies in endemic people have not been 
      thoroughly investigated. Recently, we established a serological assay system to 
      measure the balance of enhancing and neutralizing activities, which provides useful 
      information for estimating in vivo antibody status. We measured the balance of these 
      activities against four dengue virus (DENV) types in endemic populations, and 
      analyzed the proportion of sera containing enhancing and neutralizing antibodies. 
      Predominantly healthy Filipino children were used for analysis, although a 
      population of Indonesian children was also investigated. In the Filipino population, 
      the highest proportion of neutralizing activities was shown against DENV2, followed 
      by DENV1. A greater proportion of sera exhibited enhancing rather than neutralizing 
      antibodies against other virus types. Neutralizing activities were 
      complement-dependent, while enhancing activities were complement-independent. The 
      Indonesian population showed a similar dengue antibody status. Our results indicate 
      that a relatively high proportion of endemic children possessed 
      complement-independent enhancing antibodies against some DENV types.

TI  - The clinical differences between dengue and scrub typhus with acute respiratory 
      failure in southern Taiwan.
PG  - 359-65
LID - 10.1007/s15010-011-0239-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For both dengue and scrub typhus, acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a 
      serious complication. The present study was carried out in order to investigate the 
      clinical courses and outcomes of adult dengue and scrub typhus patients with ARF, 
      and to identify the clinical differences between adult dengue and scrub typhus 
      patients with ARF. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of the serologically 
      confirmed adult dengue or scrub typhus patients admitted between 1998 and 2008 at 
      Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. A total of 980 dengue and 102 scrub typhus 
      adult patients were included in our study. RESULTS: Eighteen of the 980 adult dengue 
      patients and 8 of the 102 adult scrub typhus patients had ARF. There were 
      significant differences that existed for eschar (P = 0.001; dengue 0%; scrub 62.5%), 
      cough (P = 0.016; dengue 55.6%; scrub typhus 100%), white blood cell (WBC) count 
      [P = 0.026; dengue 7.40 ± 5.74; scrub typhus 11.84 ± 4.95 (×10(3)/μL)], platelet 
      count [P = 0.008; dengue 42.2 ± 33.9; scrub typhus 104.1 ± 93.3 (×10(9)/L)], 
      prothrombin time (PT) [P = 0.007; dengue 12.82 ± 1.36; scrub typhus 10.74 ± 0.98 
      (s)], activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) [P = 0.002; dengue 50.81 ± 10.08; 
      scrub typhus 37.44 ± 4.06 (s)], blood urea nitrogen (BUN) [P < 0.001; dengue 
      64.6 ± 43.2; scrub typhus 20.9 ± 9.1 (mg/dL)], creatinine [P < 0.001; dengue 
      3.77 ± 3.37; scrub typhus 1.05 ± 0.37 (mg/dL)], admission day (A-day) [P = 0.027; 
      dengue 2.9 ± 1.3; scrub typhus 5.4 ± 2.6 (days)], and ventilator duration 
      [P = 0.022; dengue 9.4 ± 14.0; scrub typhus 14.8 ± 10.4 (days)] between both groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study provides relatively rare data regarding the clinical 
      differences between adult dengue and scrub typhus patients with ARF.

AB  - This article discusses the results of a reading-and-appropriation study, as an 
      approach methodology to narrative universe of Health Community Agents (ACS), using 
      the Dengue Almanac (AD), an information-communication device. Workshops with groups 
      of ACS from Rio de Janeiro city were developed using the Almanac, aiming it's 
      de-construction and relational reading, to improve the comprehension about 
      knowledge's construction and appropriation on dengue and health, and evaluate the AD 
      as an info-communicational device. The results were categorized within three axes: 
      informational abundance during dengue's epidemics and silence between them, meaning 
      non-information; the victim's blaming in health information's processes; ACS labor's 
      contradictions and ambiguities as mediators. The Almanac proved to be a useful tool 
      to discussion and appropriation of health information, due to the relational and 
      non-linear reading characteristics of it's contents, and the interactive and 
      nonauthoritative format of it's formulations on dengue and health.

PG  - 6408-15
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00213-12 [doi]
AB  - Dengue viruses cause two severe diseases that alter vascular fluid barrier 
      functions, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). 
      Preexisting antibodies to dengue virus disposes patients to immune-enhanced edema 
      (DSS) or hemorrhagic (DHF) disease following infection by a discrete dengue virus 
      serotype. Although the endothelium is the primary vascular fluid barrier, direct 
      effects of dengue virus on endothelial cells (ECs) have not been considered primary 
      factors in pathogenesis. Here, we show that dengue virus infection of human ECs 
      elicits immune-enhancing EC responses. Our results suggest that rapid early dengue 
      virus proliferation within ECs is permitted by dengue virus regulation of early, but 
      not late, beta interferon (IFN-β) responses. The analysis of EC responses following 
      synchronous dengue virus infection revealed the high-level induction and secretion 
      of immune cells (T cells, B cells, and mast cells) as well as activating and 
      recruiting cytokines BAFF (119-fold), IL-6/8 (4- to 7-fold), CXCL9/10/11 (45- to 
      338-fold), RANTES (724-fold), and interleukin-7 (IL-7; 128-fold). Moreover, we found 
      that properdin factor B, an alternative pathway complement activator that directs 
      chemotactic anaphylatoxin C3a and C5a production, was induced 34-fold. Thus, dengue 
      virus-infected ECs evoke key inflammatory responses observed in dengue virus 
      patients which are linked to DHF and DSS. Our findings suggest that dengue 
      virus-infected ECs directly contribute to immune enhancement, capillary 
      permeability, viremia, and immune targeting of the endothelium. These data implicate 
      EC responses in dengue virus pathogenesis and further rationalize therapeutic 
      targeting of the endothelium as a means of reducing the severity of dengue virus 
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A better description of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of 
      fatal patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is important in alerting 
      clinicians of severe dengue and improving management. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Of 309 
      adults with DHF, 10 fatal patients and 299 survivors (controls) were retrospectively 
      analyzed. Regarding causes of fatality, massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was 
      found in 4 patients, dengue shock syndrome (DSS) alone in 2; DSS/subarachnoid 
      hemorrhage, Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis/bacteremia, ventilator associated 
      pneumonia, and massive GI bleeding/Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia each in one. 
      Fatal patients were found to have significantly higher frequencies of early altered 
      consciousness (≤24 h after hospitalization), hypothermia, GI bleeding/massive GI 
      bleeding, DSS, concurrent bacteremia with/without shock, pulmonary edema, 
      renal/hepatic failure, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Among those experienced early 
      altered consciousness, massive GI bleeding alone/with uremia/with E. faecalis 
      bacteremia, and K. pneumoniae meningitis/bacteremia were each found in one patient. 
      Significantly higher proportion of bandemia from initial (arrival) laboratory data 
      in fatal patients as compared to controls, and higher proportion of pre-fatal 
      leukocytosis and lower pre-fatal platelet count as compared to initial laboratory 
      data of fatal patients were found. Massive GI bleeding (33.3%) and bacteremia (25%) 
      were the major causes of pre-fatal leukocytosis in the deceased patients; 33.3% of 
      the patients with pre-fatal profound thrombocytopenia (<20,000/µL), and 50% of the 
      patients with pre-fatal prothrombin time (PT) prolongation experienced massive GI 
      bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our report highlights causes of fatality other than DSS in 
      patients with severe dengue, and suggested hypothermia, leukocytosis and bandemia 
      may be warning signs of severe dengue. Clinicians should be alert to the potential 
      development of massive GI bleeding, particularly in patients with early altered 
      consciousness, profound thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT and/or leukocytosis. 
      Antibiotic(s) should be empirically used for patients at risk for bacteremia until 
      it is proven otherwise, especially in those with early altered consciousness and 
      leukocytosis.

TI  - Lovastatin for adult patients with dengue: protocol for a randomised controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 203
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-13-203 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most important vector-borne viral infection of man, with 
      approximately 2 billion people living in areas at risk. Infection results in a range 
      of manifestations from asymptomatic infection through to life-threatening shock and 
      haemorrhage. One of the hallmarks of severe dengue is vascular endothelial 
      disruption. There is currently no specific therapy and clinical management is 
      limited to supportive care. Statins are a class of drug initially developed for 
      lipid lowering. There has been considerable recent interest in their effects beyond 
      lipid lowering. These include anti-inflammatory effects at the endothelium. In 
      addition, it is possible that lovastatin may have an anti-viral effect against 
      dengue. Observational data suggest that the use of statins may improve outcomes for 
      such conditions as sepsis and pneumonia. This paper describes the protocol for a 
      randomised controlled trial investigating a short course of lovastatin therapy in 
      adult patients with dengue. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomised, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial will investigate the effects of lovastatin therapy in the 
      treatment of dengue. The trial will be conducted in two phases with an escalation of 
      dose between phases if an interim safety review is satisfactory. This is an 
      exploratory study focusing on safety and there are no data on which to base a sample 
      size calculation. A target sample size of 300 patients in the second phase, enrolled 
      over two dengue seasons, was chosen based on clinical judgement and feasibility 
      considerations. In a previous randomised trial in dengue, about 10% and 30% of 
      patients experienced at least one serious adverse event or adverse event, 
      respectively. With 300 patients, we will have 80% power to detect an increase of 12% 
      (from 10% to 22%) or 16% (from 30% to 46%) in the frequency of adverse events. 
      Furthermore, this sample size ensures some power to explore the efficacy of statins. 
      DISCUSSION: The development of a dengue therapeutic that can attenuate disease would 
      be an enormous advance in global health. The favourable effects of statins on the 
      endothelium, their good safety profile and their low cost make lovastatin an 
      attractive therapeutic candidate. TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard 
      Randomised Controlled Trial Number ISRCTN03147572.

AB  - Dengue fever is a disease of increasing relevance to international travellers. 
      Transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes, it is recognised as the most common 
      arthropod-borne infection worldwide. With no vaccine available to prevent infection, 
      accurate pre-travel advice and post-travel follow up is necessary. Healthcare 
      professionals who provide advice to overseas travellers need to have a comprehensive 
      understanding of the disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Primary physicians and nurses serve as the first-line health 
      care providers of dengue virus infection diagnosis, notification, and treatment. 
      Knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among primary healthcare professionals 
      (HCPs) regarding dengue diseases may pace alarm and improve the outcome of dengue 
      control. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using a structured quiz in 264 HCPs 
      (response rate, 76%) was conducted in Tainan City in southern Taiwan. The quiz 
      consisted of 10 questions regarding the control measures, notification, and clinical 
      practices of dengue diseases. Scores of KAP and demographic characteristics of HCPs 
      were analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four physicians and 130 nurses comprise 
      the 264 HCP responders. Forty-three physicians (32%) and 80 nurses (61.5%) were 
      practicing in medical centers, and they scored higher than nonmedical center peers 
      on quizzes on notification (1.18 vs. 0.93 points, p < 0.01) but lower on control 
      measures (3.52 vs. 3.22 points, p < 0.01). Fifty-seven physicians (42.5%) were 
      experienced in reporting suspected dengue cases, and 13.1% of nurses had reported 
      dengue cases. Three-fourths of HCPs failed to respond to the timing of dengue case 
      notification, whereas nurses scored higher than physicians (0.34 vs. 0.16, 
      p < 0.01). In addition, 57.2% of the HCPs failed to respond correctly to the timing 
      of typical skin rashes occurring in the patients with dengue. More than half of the 
      HCPs considered Taiwan an endemic area of dengue diseases. CONCLUSION: This pilot 
      study showed a lack of acquaintance with notification timing and important clinical 
      features of dengue among HCPs in southern Taiwan. Future continued medical/nursing 
      education should place more emphasis on these factors to improve dengue control in 
      this demographic area.

PG  - 536-9
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.10-0670 [doi]
AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever is characterized by the presence of a capillary leak 
      syndrome. Its pathogenesis is presumed to differ from that of classical dengue fever 
      (DF) and to be associated with secondary dengue infection. Returning travelers given 
      a diagnosis of DF were evaluated for capillary leakage with abdominal sonography. 
      Data were compared between travelers with primary/secondary infection defined by 
      epidemiologic and serologic parameters. A total of 12 (34.3%) of 35 patients had 
      sonographic signs of capillary leakage. Most (85%) patients with capillary leakage 
      had classical DF. Capillary leak was diagnosed in 32% of primary dengue cases and in 
      40% of secondary dengue cases (P = 0.69). The two patients given a diagnosis of 
      dengue hemorrhagic fever had primary infections. The high prevalence of capillary 
      leakage among travelers, most of them with primary exposure to dengue, calls into 
      question the importance of secondary infection in causing capillary leakage in 
      dengue infection.

      time-series study.
PG  - 98
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-12-98 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While floods can potentially increase the transmission of dengue, only 
      few studies have reported the association of dengue epidemics with flooding. We 
      estimated the effects of river levels and rainfall on the hospital admissions for 
      dengue fever at 11 major hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. METHODS: We examined 
      time-series of the number of hospital admissions of dengue fever in relation to 
      river levels from 2005 to 2009 using generalized linear Poisson regression models 
      adjusting for seasonal, between-year variation, public holidays and temperature. 
      RESULTS: There was strong evidence for an increase in dengue fever at high river 
      levels. Hospitalisations increased by 6.9% (95% CI: 3.2, 10.7) for each 0.1 metre 
      increase above a threshold (3.9 metres) for the average river level over lags of 
      0-5 weeks. Conversely, the number of hospitalisations increased by 29.6% (95% CI: 
      19.8, 40.2) for a 0.1 metre decrease below the same threshold of the average river 
      level over lags of 0-19 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that 
      factors associated with both high and low river levels increase the hospitalisations 
      of dengue fever cases in Dhaka.

AB  - With the dramatic increase of the worldwide threat of dengue disease, it has been 
      very crucial to correctly diagnose the dengue patients in order to decrease the 
      disease severity. However, it has been a great challenge for the physicians to 
      identify the level of risk in dengue patients due to overlapping of the medical 
      classification criteria. Therefore, this study aims to construct a noninvasive 
      diagnostic system to assist the physicians for classifying the risk in dengue 
      patients. Systematic producers have been followed to develop the system. Firstly, 
      the assessment of the significant predictors associated with the level of risk in 
      dengue patients was carried out utilizing the statistical analyses technique. 
      Secondly, Multilayer perceptron neural network models trained via 
      Levenberg-Marquardt and Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithms was employed for 
      constructing the diagnostic system. Finally, precise tuning for the models' 
      parameters was conducted in order to achieve the optimal performance. As a result, 9 
      noninvasive predictors were found to be significantly associated with the level of 
      risk in dengue patients. By employing those predictors, 75% prediction accuracy has 
      been achieved for classifying the risk in dengue patients using Scaled Conjugate 
      Gradient algorithm while 70.7% prediction accuracy were achieved by using 
      Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

TI  - Manifestation and outcome of concurrent malaria and dengue infection.
PG  - 262-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies on concurrent infection of dengue and malaria are uncommon in 
      India. Therefore, in this study, we compared the clinical features and outcome of 
      concurrent infection with mono-infection of dengue and malaria. METHODS: All the 
      patients of fever within 7 days duration were investigated for dengue, malaria and 
      other causes of fever. Patients of concurrent dengue and malaria (Group A) were 
      compared with dengue mono-infection (Group B) and malaria mono-infection (Group C). 
      Biochemical and haematological investigations were done and compared. RESULTS: 
      During the study period 367 patients of dengue were admitted. Concurrent infection 
      of dengue and malaria was found in 27 (7.4%) patients. There were 27 (5.8), 340 
      (72.5), and 102 (21.7%) patients in Groups A, B, and C respectively. The clinical 
      features of concurrent infection were more like dengue than malaria. Unlike malaria 
      the outcome of concurrent infection is good. CONCLUSION: Concurrent infection of 
      dengue and malaria is not uncommon. For the diagnosis investigations for both the 
      infections should be carried out routinely.

AB  - The present study estimates the economic burden associated with the cases of dengue 
      recorded during the 2009 Argentine epidemic. Among the costs considered are the 
      medical costs necessary for the treatment of those affected and the opportunity 
      costs for those who stopped working or studying because of the disease. In order to 
      assess the costs of the disease, at the end of 2009 an ad-hoc survey was carried out 
      in 201 households where people that had contracted dengue during the 2009 epidemic 
      lived. The results allow us to estimate between 26 to 40 million Argentine pesos (6 
      to 9 million US dollars) as the total cost of the recorded cases. The regions in the 
      north of Argentina bore the highest economic burden of the disease (more than 90% of 
      the total burden). For all regions, the social cost of one dengue case accounts for 
      more than 40% of the average monthly net individual income.

AB  - Dengue is considered an emerging disease with an increasing prevalence especially in 
      South America. In 2002, an epidemic of classic Dengue (DENV-1) occurred unexpectedly 
      on Easter Island, where it had never been detected before. It reappeared in 
      2006-2007 and 2008, 2009 and 2011. The aim of this study was to estimate the most 
      relevant parameters of the epidemiological dynamics of transmission of Dengue on 
      Easter Island and to model the dynamics since 2002, comparing the predictions with 
      the actual situation observed. Of the total cases, 52.27% were females and 47.73% 
      men. The average age of infection was 31.38 ± 18.37 years, similar in men and women. 
      We estimated the reproductive number R0 = 3.005 with an IC0,95 = [1.92, 4.61]. The 
      inter-epidemic period reached an estimated T = 5.20 to 6.8 years. The case 
      simulation showed recurrent epidemics with decreasing magnitude (damped 
      oscillations), which is a known phenomenon in models of dengue and malaria. There 
      was good qualitative fit to the epidemiological dynamics from 2002 onwards. It 
      accurately predicted the rise in cases between 2006 and 2011. The predicted number 
      of cases during the 2002 epidemic is greater than the confirmed cases and the 
      predicted epidemic was faster than notified cases. Interepidemic period in the 
      simulation was 6.72 years between 2002 and 2008 and 4.68 years between 2008 and 
      2013. From the theoretical perspective, the first epidemic had affected 94% of the 
      population (approximately 3500 cases), but 639 were reported suggesting 
      underreporting and a lot of sub-clinical cases occurred. Future epidemic of 
      decreasing size are expected, although the main danger are epidemics of hemorrhagic 
      dengue fever resulting from the introduction of different dengue virus serotypes.

TI  - Spatial pattern of 2009 dengue distribution in Kuala Lumpur using GIS application.
PG  - 113-20
AB  - In the last few years in Malaysia, dengue fever has increased dramatically and has 
      caused huge public health concerns. The present study aimed to establish a spatial 
      distribution of dengue cases in the city of Kuala Lumpur using a combination of 
      Geographic Information System (GIS) and spatial statistical tools. Collation of data 
      from 1,618 dengue cases in 2009 was obtained from Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL). 
      These data were processed and then converted into GIS format. Information on the 
      average monthly rainfall was also used to correlate with the distribution pattern of 
      dengue cases. To asses the spatial distribution of dengue cases, Average Nearest 
      Neighbor (ANN) Analysis was applied together with spatial analysis with the ESRI 
      ArcGIS V9.3 programme. Results indicated that the distribution of dengue cases in 
      Kuala Lumpur for the year 2009 was spatially clustered with R value less than 1 (R = 
      0.42; z-scores = - 4.47; p < 0.001). Nevertheless, when this pattern was further 
      analyzed according to month by each zone within Kuala Lumpur, two distinct patterns 
      were observed which include a clustered pattern (R value < 1) between April to June 
      and a dispersed pattern (R value > 1) between August and November. In addition, the 
      mean monthly rainfall has not influenced the distribution pattern of the dengue 
      cases. Implementation of control measures is more difficult for dispersed pattern 
      compared to clustered pattern. From this study, it was found that distribution 
      pattern of dengue cases in Kuala Lumpur in 2009 was spatially distributed (dispersed 
      or clustered) rather than cases occurring randomly. It was proven that by using GIS 
      and spatial statistic tools, we can determine the spatial distribution between 
      dengue and population. Utilization of GIS tools is vital in assisting health 
      agencies, epidemiologist, public health officer, town planner and relevant 
      authorities in developing efficient control measures and contingency programmes to 
      effectively combat dengue fever.

AB  - Dengue viruses are major contributors to illness and death globally. Here we analyze 
      the extrinsic and intrinsic incubation periods (EIP and IIP), in the mosquito and 
      human, respectively. We identified 146 EIP observations from 8 studies and 204 IIP 
      observations from 35 studies. These data were fitted with censored Bayesian 
      time-to-event models. The best-fitting temperature-dependent EIP model estimated 
      that 95% of EIPs are between 5 and 33 days at 25°C, and 2 and 15 days at 30°C, with 
      means of 15 and 6.5 days, respectively. The mean IIP estimate was 5.9 days, with 95% 
      expected between days 3 and 10. Differences between serotypes were not identified 
      for either incubation period. These incubation period models should be useful in 
      clinical diagnosis, outbreak investigation, prevention and control efforts, and 
      mathematical modeling of dengue virus transmission.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the seroincidence of dengue in children living in Salvador, 
      Bahia, Brazil and to evaluate the factors associated. METHODS:   A prospective 
      serological survey was carried out in a sample of children 0-3 years of age. A 
      multilevel logistic model was used to identify the determinants of seroincidence. 
      RESULTS: The seroprevalence of dengue was 26.6% in the 625 children evaluated. A 
      second survey detected an incidence of 33.2%. Multilevel logistic regression showed 
      a statistically significant association between the seroincidence of dengue and age 
      and the premises index. CONCLUSION: In Salvador, the dengue virus is in active 
      circulation during early childhood; consequently, children have heterotypic 
      antibodies and run a high risk of developing dengue haemorrhagic fever, because the 
      sequence and intensity of the three dengue virus serotypes currently circulating in 
      this city are very similar to those that were circulating in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 
      in 2008. Therefore, the authors strongly recommend that the health authorities in 
      cities with a similar epidemiological scenario be aware of this risk and implement 
      improvements in health care, particularly targeting the paediatric age groups. In 
      addition, information should be provided to the population and actions should be 
      implemented to combat this vector.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), a globally emerging cause of undifferentiated fever, has been 
      documented in the heavily urbanized western coast of Sri Lanka since the 1960s. New 
      areas of Sri Lanka are now being affected, and the reported number and severity of 
      cases have increased. To study emerging DENV in southern Sri Lanka, we obtained 
      epidemiologic and clinical data and acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples from 
      patients >2 years old with febrile illness. We tested paired serum samples for DENV 
      IgG and IgM and serotyped virus by using isolation and reverse transcription PCR. We 
      identified acute DENV infection (serotypes 2, 3, and 4) in 54 (6.3%) of 859 
      patients. Only 14% of patients had clinically suspected dengue; however, 54% had 
      serologically confirmed acute or past DENV infection. DENV is a major and largely 
      unrecognized cause of fever in southern Sri Lanka, especially in young adults.

AB  - Dengue fever is a noncontagious infectious disease caused by dengue virus (DENV). 
      DENV belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, and is classified into 
      four antigenically distinct serotypes: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. The 
      number of nations and people affected has increased steadily and today is considered 
      the most widely spread arbovirus (arthropod-borne viral disease) in the world. The 
      absence of an appropriate animal model for studying the disease has hindered the 
      understanding of dengue pathogenesis. In our study, we have found that 
      immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice infected intraperitoneally with DENV-1 presented some 
      signs of dengue disease such as thrombocytopenia, spleen hemorrhage, liver damage, 
      and increase in production of IFNγ and TNFα cytokines. Moreover, the animals became 
      viremic and the virus was detected in several organs by real-time RT-PCR. Thus, this 
      animal model could be used to study mechanism of dengue virus infection, to test 
      antiviral drugs, as well as to evaluate candidate vaccines.

AB  - Dengue is one of the most important arboviral diseases caused by infection of four 
      serotypes of dengue virus (DEN). We found that activation of interferon regulatory 
      factor 3 (IRF3) triggered by viral infection and by foreign DNA and RNA stimulation 
      was blocked by DEN-encoded NS2B3 through a protease-dependent mechanism. The key 
      adaptor protein in type I interferon pathway, human mediator of IRF3 activation 
      (MITA) but not the murine homologue MPYS, was cleaved in cells infected with DEN-1 
      or DEN-2 and with expression of the enzymatically active protease NS2B3. The 
      cleavage site of MITA was mapped to LRR↓(96)G and the function of MITA was 
      suppressed by dengue protease. DEN replication was reduced with overexpression of 
      MPYS but not with MITA, while DEN replication was enhanced by MPYS knockdown, 
      indicating an antiviral role of MITA/MPYS against DEN infection. The involvement of 
      MITA in DEN-triggered innate immune response was evidenced by reduction of IRF3 
      activation and IFN induction in cells with MITA knockdown upon DEN-2 infection. 
      NS2B3 physically interacted with MITA, and the interaction and cleavage of MITA 
      could be further enhanced by poly(dA:dT) stimulation. Thus, we identified MITA as a 
      novel host target of DEN protease and provide the molecular mechanism of how DEN 
      subverts the host innate immunity.

TI  - Dengue vector control and surveillance during a major outbreak in a coastal Red Sea 
      area in Sudan.
PG  - 1217-24
AB  - An unprecedented dengue outbreak occurred in 2010 in Port Sudan city, Sudan. Dengue 
      incidence was 94 cases per 10 000 observed over 17 epidemiological weeks (total 
      cases = 3 765). We report here the impact of the vector control response plan to the 
      outbreak, which mainly entailed house inspection and insecticide space spraying. In 
      total 3 048 houses were inspected during vector surveillance and 19 794 larvae and 3 
      240 pupae of Aedes aegypti were collected. Entomological indices decreased during 
      the period: house index declined from 100% to 16% (F= 57.8, P < 0.001) and 
      pupal/person (P/P) index from 0.77 to 0.10 (F= 3.06, P < 0.01) in weeks 9 and 21 
      respectively. This decline was accompanied by a decrease in cases from a peak of 341 
      cases in week 13 to zero in week 29 and the end of the outbreak. There was a 
      significant correlation between the entomological parameters and dengue incidence 
      (R2 = 0.83, F= 23.9, P < 0.001). Integrated epidemiological and vector surveillance 
      is essential to an effective dengue control programme

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a growing problem both in its geographical spread and in its 
      intensity, and yet current global distribution remains highly uncertain. Challenges 
      in diagnosis and diagnostic methods as well as highly variable national health 
      systems mean no single data source can reliably estimate the distribution of this 
      disease. As such, there is a lack of agreement on national dengue status among 
      international health organisations. Here we bring together all available information 
      on dengue occurrence using a novel approach to produce an evidence consensus map of 
      the disease range that highlights nations with an uncertain dengue status. 
      METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A baseline methodology was used to assess a range of 
      evidence for each country. In regions where dengue status was uncertain, additional 
      evidence types were included to either clarify dengue status or confirm that it is 
      unknown at this time. An algorithm was developed that assesses evidence quality and 
      consistency, giving each country an evidence consensus score. Using this approach, 
      we were able to generate a contemporary global map of national-level dengue status 
      that assigns a relative measure of certainty and identifies gaps in the available 
      evidence. CONCLUSION: The map produced here provides a list of 128 countries for 
      which there is good evidence of dengue occurrence, including 36 countries that have 
      previously been classified as dengue-free by the World Health Organization and/or 
      the US Centers for Disease Control. It also identifies disease surveillance needs, 
      which we list in full. The disease extents and limits determined here using evidence 
      consensus, marks the beginning of a five-year study to advance the mapping of dengue 
      virus transmission and disease risk. Completion of this first step has allowed us to 
      produce a preliminary estimate of population at risk with an upper bound of 3.97 
      billion people. This figure will be refined in future work.

LID - 10.1097/CCM.0b013e318232d966 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dengue continues to cause significant global morbidity and mortality. 
      Severe disease is characterized by cardiovascular compromise from capillary leakage. 
      Cardiac involvement in dengue has also been reported but has not been adequately 
      studied. SETTING: Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 
      SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: Seventy-nine patients aged 8-6 yrs with different dengue 
      severity grades were studied using echocardiography including tissue Doppler 
      imaging. The patients were split into severity grades: dengue, dengue with warning 
      signs, and severe dengue. Changes in cardiac functional parameters and hemodynamic 
      indices were monitored over the hospital stay. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      MAIN RESULTS: Patients with severe dengue had worse cardiac function compared with 
      dengue in the form of left ventricular systolic dysfunction with increased left 
      myocardial performance index (0.58 [0.26-0.80] vs. 0.38 [0.22-0.70], p = .006). 
      Septal myocardial systolic velocities were reduced (6.4 [4.8-10] vs. 8.1 [6-13] 
      cm/s, p = .01) as well as right ventricular systolic (11.4 [7.5-17] vs. 13.5 [10-17] 
      cm/s, p = .016) and diastolic velocities (13 [8-23] vs. 17 [12-25] cm/s, p = .0026). 
      In the severe group, these parameters improved from hospital admission to discharge; 
      septal myocardial systolic velocities to 8.8 (7-11) cm/s (p = .002), right 
      ventricular myocardial systolic velocities to 15.0 (11.8-23) cm/s, (p = .003), and 
      diastolic velocity to 21 (11-25) cm/s (p = .002). Patients with cardiac impairment 
      were more likely to have significant pleural effusions. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 
      severe dengue have evidence of systolic and diastolic cardiac impairment with septal 
      and right ventricular wall being predominantly affected.

TI  - Dengue virus infection in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 900-3
AB  - This is a case report of a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) undergoing 
      imatinib treatment who became infected with dengue virus. The patient presented with 
      classic dengue symptoms, along with early minor bleeding (blood-stained sputum) 
      during the first 5 days of illness. Continuous inpatient imatinib treatment for CML 
      was given without blood transfusion. The hemoglobin and white blood-cell count 
      slowly improved over 30 days while recovering from the dengue viral infection. The 
      patient recovered from the dengue virus infection without complication. Clinical 
      monitoring of hematologic changes is needed in dengue patients undergoing anticancer 
      treatment.

TI  - Dengue fever presenting with hepatitis.
PG  - 335-6
AB  - Dengue virus is one of the most common known causes of arboviral disease. Classic 
      dengue fever (DF) is rarely fatal, but it may be incapacitating and require 
      hospitalization. Atypical forms have been described involving the cardiac system, 
      the central nervous system, and the hepatobiliary system. A 47-year-old white man 
      returning from Ecuador presented with daily fevers, headaches, myalgias, vomiting, 
      and no abnormal physical examination findings. His laboratory findings were notable 
      for transaminitis and elevated DF convalescence titers. He was subsequently 
      diagnosed with DF. This case is somewhat atypical because a literature search 
      revealed no cases of transaminitis with classic DF in Central America with the same 
      particular pattern as in this patient. Given the increase in global travel, an 
      increase in DF with a wide range of organ involvement among those returning to the 
      United States from endemic areas should be expected.

      process-based modeling approach.

LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0451 [doi]
AB  - The impact of weather variation on dengue transmission in Cairns, Australia, was 
      determined by applying a process-based dengue simulation model (DENSiM) that 
      incorporated local meteorologic, entomologic, and demographic data. Analysis showed 
      that inter-annual weather variation is one of the significant determinants of dengue 
      outbreak receptivity. Cross-correlation analyses showed that DENSiM simulated 
      epidemics of similar relative magnitude and timing to those historically recorded in 
      reported dengue cases in Cairns during 1991-2009, (r = 0.372, P < 0.01). The DENSiM 
      model can now be used to study the potential impacts of future climate change on 
      dengue transmission. Understanding the impact of climate variation on the geographic 
      range, seasonality, and magnitude of dengue transmission will enhance development of 
      adaptation strategies to minimize future disease burden in Australia.

PG  - 468-71
LID - 10.1097/WNP.0b013e31826be029 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to document the muscle involvement in dengue 
      virus infection using quantitative electromyography (QEMG). METHODS: The patients 
      with dengue myopathy were subjected to clinical examination including muscle power, 
      tone, reflex, and sensations. Blood counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum creatine 
      kinase (CK), and electrolytes were determined. The QEMG was performed in the biceps 
      using multimotor unit potential analysis program. Muscle biopsy was done in two 
      patients. At 1 month, their clinical and QEMG analyses were repeated. RESULTS: 
      Thirteen patients whose median age was 34 years were included. Seven patients had 
      severe and six had mild weakness, which was more marked in proximal lower limb 
      muscles. The median CK level was 480 (300-2,477) U/L. Needle EMG did not reveal any 
      spontaneous activity. The motor unit potentials (MUPs) were of normal to short 
      duration, polyphasic with normal interference pattern. The QEMG revealed a 
      significant change in the duration of MUP at 1 month compared with that of baseline. 
      All the patients clinically and biochemically improved after 1 month. Muscle biopsy 
      revealed interstitial hemorrhage with occasional myonecrosis and myophagocytosis 
      without inflammation or vasculitis. CONCLUSIONS: The QEMG in dengue myopathy 
      revealed improvement in the duration of MUP at 1-month follow-up, which paralleled 
      with clinical and CK improvement.

TI  - Seroprevalence of dengue infection: a cross-sectional survey in mainland Tanzania 
      and on Pemba Island, Zanzibar.
PG  - e44-6
LID - 10.1016/j.ijid.2011.09.018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evidence available to date indicates that dengue viruses 1, 2, and 3 
      could be among the causes of acute fever in eastern Africa. Recently, four reports 
      on dengue infection in travelers and residents have raised concerns over the 
      occurrence of dengue fever in mainland Tanzania and in Zanzibar. The objective of 
      this study was to provide seroprevalence data on dengue infection in Tanzania. 
      METHODS: This study was conducted in 2007 at two peripheral hospitals, one on Pemba 
      Island, Zanzibar and one in Tosamaganga, Iringa Region, mainland Tanzania. Two 
      hundred and two consecutive febrile outpatients were studied for antibodies and 
      viral RNA to assess the circulation of dengue virus in Tanzania. RESULTS: A 
      seroprevalence of 7.7% was found on Pemba Island and of 1.8% was found in 
      Tosamaganga. No acute cases and no previous infections among patients under 11 years 
      of age were detected. CONCLUSION: These findings provide the first baseline data on 
      dengue seroprevalence in the country. No recent dengue virus circulation in Tanzania 
      and in the Zanzibar archipelago up until the early 1990s is reported.

PG  - 78-82
LID - 10.3201/eid1801.110191 [doi]
AB  - During the late summers of 1927 and 1928, a biphasic dengue epidemic affected the 
      Athens, Greece, metropolitan area; >90% of the population became sick, and >1,000 
      persons (1,553 in the entire country) died. This epidemic was the most recent and 
      most serious dengue fever epidemic in Europe. Review of all articles published by 
      one of the most influential Greek daily newspapers (I Kathimerini) during the 
      epidemic and the years that followed it did not shed light on the controversy about 
      whether the high number of deaths resulted from dengue hemorrhagic fever after 
      sequential infections with dengue virus types 1 and 2 or to a particularly virulent 
      type 1 virus. Nevertheless, study of the old reports is crucial considering the 
      relatively recent introduction of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and the frequent 
      warnings of a possible reemergence of dengue fever in Europe.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tens of millions of dengue cases and approximately 500,000 
      life-threatening complications occur annually. New tools are needed to distinguish 
      dengue from other febrile illnesses. In addition, the natural history of pediatric 
      dengue early in illness in a community-based setting has not been well-defined. 
      METHODS: Data from the multi-year, ongoing Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study of 
      approximately 3,800 children aged 2-14 years in Managua, Nicaragua, were used to 
      examine the frequency of clinical signs and symptoms by day of illness and to 
      generate models for the association of signs and symptoms during the early phase of 
      illness and over the entire course of illness with testing dengue-positive. Odds 
      ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using generalized 
      estimating equations (GEE) for repeated measures, adjusting for age and gender. 
      RESULTS: One-fourth of children who tested dengue-positive did not meet the WHO case 
      definition for suspected dengue. The frequency of signs and symptoms varied by day 
      of illness, dengue status, and disease severity. Multivariable GEE models showed 
      increased odds of testing dengue-positive associated with fever, headache, 
      retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, petechiae, positive tourniquet test, 
      vomiting, leukopenia, platelets ≤150,000 cells/mL, poor capillary refill, cold 
      extremities and hypotension. Estimated ORs tended to be higher for signs and 
      symptoms over the course of illness compared to the early phase of illness. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Day-by-day analysis of clinical signs and symptoms together with 
      longitudinal statistical analysis showed significant associations with testing 
      dengue-positive and important differences during the early phase of illness compared 
      to the entire course of illness. These findings stress the importance of considering 
      day of illness when developing prediction algorithms for real-time clinical 
      management.

AB  - The authors present 2 cases of dengue shock syndrome with unusual complications. In 
      the first case, a 14-y-old boy with dengue shock syndrome who required aggressive 
      fluid resuscitation, developed abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Patient 
      developed severe shock, increased ventilator requirement and oliguria as a 
      consequence of ACS. Patient responded well to abdominal paracentesis draining 2.7 l 
      of fluid and made rapid recovery. In the second case, 8-y-old girl was treated for 
      dengue shock syndrome, including mechanical ventilation for ARDS. In the second wk 
      of illness, she developed severe neurological manifestations including frequent 
      episodes of convulsions, hallucinations and altered sensorium. She was diagnosed to 
      have acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis from CT brain findings. She responded 
      well to pulse steroid therapy with complete neurological recovery.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) capsid (C) proteins are the major structural component of virus 
      particles. This study aimed to identify the host interacting partners of DENV C 
      protein that could contribute to viral pathogenesis. DENV C protein was screened 
      against human liver cDNA yeast two-hybrid library. We identified calcium modulating 
      cyclophilin-binding ligand (CAML) as a novel interacting partner of DENV C protein. 
      We report for the first time that CAML influenced DENV production. DENV production 
      was significantly attenuated in CAML knock-down cells at 36h post-infection. CAML 
      did not influence DENV entry, genome uncoating, viral transcription, viral 
      translation and virus secretion. Our study pinpointed that CAML influenced the 
      process of apoptosis by altering mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3 
      activation from 36h post-infection. Over-expression of CAML protected Huh7 cells 
      from apoptosis and knock down of CAML favoured apoptosis following infection with 
      DENV. We also showed that CAML expression was up-regulated during DENV infection. 
      Increased CAML levels protected DENV-infected cells from undergoing apoptosis by 
      preventing mitochondrial damage and caspase-3 activation which in turn favoured DENV 
      production from 36h post-infection. Overall, this study demonstrated that DENV 
      manipulated the levels of CAML to subvert the apoptotic process which in turn 
      favoured efficient virus production.

TI  - DengueTools: innovative tools and strategies for the surveillance and control of 
      dengue.
LID - 10.3402/gha.v5i0.17273 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease estimated to cause about 230 million 
      infections worldwide every year, of which 25,000 are fatal. Global incidence has 
      risen rapidly in recent decades with some 3.6 billion people, over half of the 
      world's population, now at risk, mainly in urban centres of the tropics and 
      subtropics. Demographic and societal changes, in particular urbanization, 
      globalization, and increased international travel, are major contributors to the 
      rise in incidence and geographic expansion of dengue infections. Major research gaps 
      continue to hamper the control of dengue. The European Commission launched a call 
      under the 7th Framework Programme with the title of 'Comprehensive control of Dengue 
      fever under changing climatic conditions'. Fourteen partners from several countries 
      in Europe, Asia, and South America formed a consortium named 'DengueTools' to 
      respond to the call to achieve better diagnosis, surveillance, prevention, and 
      predictive models and improve our understanding of the spread of dengue to 
      previously uninfected regions (including Europe) in the context of globalization and 
      climate change.The consortium comprises 12 work packages to address a set of 
      research questions in three areas:Research area 1: Develop a comprehensive early 
      warning and surveillance system that has predictive capability for epidemic dengue 
      and benefits from novel tools for laboratory diagnosis and vector 
      monitoring.Research area 2: Develop novel strategies to prevent dengue in 
      children.Research area 3: Understand and predict the risk of global spread of 
      dengue, in particular the risk of introduction and establishment in Europe, within 
      the context of parameters of vectorial capacity, global mobility, and climate 
      change.In this paper, we report on the rationale and specific study objectives of 
      'DengueTools'. DengueTools is funded under the Health theme of the Seventh Framework 
      Programme of the European Community, Grant Agreement Number: 282589 Dengue Tools.

AB  - Dengue viremia may be the trigger for immune complex formation in patients who are 
      predisposed to developing autoimmune disease. We report a rare case of dengue virus 
      infection evolving into systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis. To 
      the best of our knowledge this is the first case of dengue fever evolving into lupus 
      nephritis. A 22 year old female presented with having had high grade fever, skin 
      rash, breathlessness, retro-orbital pain, abdominal pain, arthralgias and myalgias 
      for 10 days. She tested positive for dengue immunoglobulin M (IgM). She was given 
      supportive treatment and was subsequently discharged. Four weeks later she developed 
      recurrent fever, arthralgia, rash and anasarca. She was suspected as having SLE with 
      active lupus nephritis. Antinuclear antibody (ANA), and anti double stranded 
      deoxyribonucleic acid (anti dsDNA) titers were positive and complements were low. 
      Renal biopsy showed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis grade IV. She was 
      treated with steroids and immunosuppressants to which she responded. Dengue viremia 
      incites antibody production, which if excessive causes deposition of viral 
      antigen-antibody immune complexes. This could possibly lead to renal tubular damage 
      and glomerulonephritis in susceptible individuals. Dengue fever leading to 
      development of glomerulonephritis is rarely seen. Our patient developed dengue fever 
      and after a month presented with manifestations of SLE and lupus nephritis. Both 
      dengue fever and SLE have common manifestations of fever, arthralgia, rash, 
      leucopenia with thrombocytopenia and serositis. Bacterial and viral infections may 
      act as a 'trigger' for starting or relapsing lupus activity in genetically 
      predetermined individuals. In our case it may be possible that dengue virus could 
      have triggered a dysfunctional immune response, resulting in the developing of 
      autoimmunity and SLE with lupus nephritis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALT) is prominent in acute dengue illness. The World Health 
      Organization (WHO) 2009 dengue guidelines defined AST or ALT ≥ 1000 units/liter 
      (U/L) as a criterion for severe dengue. We aimed to assess the clinical relevance 
      and discriminatory value of AST or ALT for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and severe 
      dengue. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We retrospectively studied and classified 
      polymerase chain reaction positive dengue patients from 2006 to 2008 treated at Tan 
      Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore according to WHO 1997 and 2009 criteria for dengue 
      severity. Of 690 dengue patients, 31% had DHF and 24% severe dengue. Elevated AST 
      and ALT occurred in 86% and 46%, respectively. Seven had AST or ALT ≥ 1000 U/L. None 
      had acute liver failure but one patient died. Median AST and ALT values were 
      significantly higher with increasing dengue severity by both WHO 1997 and 2009 
      criteria. However, they were poorly discriminatory between non-severe and severe 
      dengue (e.g., AST area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve=0.62; 
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57-0.67) and between dengue fever (DF) and DHF (AST 
      area under the ROC curve=0.56; 95% CI: 0.52-0.61). There was significant overlap in 
      AST and ALT values among patients with dengue with or without warning signs and 
      severe dengue, and between those with DF and DHF. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      aminotransferase levels increased in conjunction with dengue severity, AST or ALT 
      values did not discriminate between DF and DHF or non-severe and severe dengue.

TI  - House-to-house human movement drives dengue virus transmission.
PG  - 994-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1213349110 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease of growing global health importance. Prevention 
      efforts focus on mosquito control, with limited success. New insights into the 
      spatiotemporal drivers of dengue dynamics are needed to design improved 
      disease-prevention strategies. Given the restricted range of movement of the primary 
      mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, local human movements may be an important driver of 
      dengue virus (DENV) amplification and spread. Using contact-site cluster 
      investigations in a case-control design, we demonstrate that, at an individual 
      level, risk for human infection is defined by visits to places where contact with 
      infected mosquitoes is likely, independent of distance from the home. Our data 
      indicate that house-to-house human movements underlie spatial patterns of DENV 
      incidence, causing marked heterogeneity in transmission rates. At a collective 
      level, transmission appears to be shaped by social connections because routine 
      movements among the same places, such as the homes of family and friends, are often 
      similar for the infected individual and their contacts. Thus, routine, 
      house-to-house human movements do play a key role in spread of this vector-borne 
      pathogen at fine spatial scales. This finding has important implications for dengue 
      prevention, challenging the appropriateness of current approaches to vector control. 
      We argue that reexamination of existing paradigms regarding the spatiotemporal 
      dynamics of DENV and other vector-borne pathogens, especially the importance of 
      human movement, will lead to improvements in disease prevention.

TI  - Is temperature the main cause of dengue rise in non-endemic countries? The case of 
      Argentina.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.1186/1476-072X-11-26 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue cases have increased during the last decades, particularly in 
      non-endemic areas, and Argentina was no exception in the southern transmission 
      fringe. Although temperature rise has been blamed for this, human population growth, 
      increased travel and inefficient vector control may also be implicated. The relative 
      contribution of geographic, demographic and climatic of variables on the occurrence 
      of dengue cases was evaluated. METHODS: According to dengue history in the country, 
      the study was divided in two decades, a first decade corresponding to the 
      reemergence of the disease and the second including several epidemics. Annual dengue 
      risk was modeled by a temperature-based mechanistic model as annual days of possible 
      transmission. The spatial distribution of dengue occurrence was modeled as a 
      function of the output of the mechanistic model, climatic, geographic and 
      demographic variables for both decades. RESULTS: According to the temperature-based 
      model dengue risk increased between the two decades, and epidemics of the last 
      decade coincided with high annual risk. Dengue spatial occurrence was best modeled 
      by a combination of climatic, demographic and geographic variables and province as a 
      grouping factor. It was positively associated with days of possible transmission, 
      human population number, population fall and distance to water bodies. When 
      considered separately, the classification performance of demographic variables was 
      higher than that of climatic and geographic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Temperature, 
      though useful to estimate annual transmission risk, does not fully describe the 
      distribution of dengue occurrence at the country scale. Indeed, when taken 
      separately, climatic variables performed worse than geographic or demographic 
      variables. A combination of the three types was best for this task.

TI  - Recombinant nucleocapsid-like particles from dengue-2 induce functional 
      serotype-specific cell-mediated immunity in mice.
PG  - 1204-1214
LID - 10.1099/vir.0.037721-0 [doi]
AB  - The interplay of different inflammatory cytokines induced during dengue virus 
      infection plays a role in either protection or increased disease severity. In this 
      sense, vaccine strategies incorporating whole virus are able to elicit both 
      functional and pathological responses. Therefore, an ideal tetravalent vaccine 
      candidate against dengue should be focused on serotype-specific sequences. In the 
      present work, a new formulation of nucleocapsid-like particles (NLPs) obtained from 
      the recombinant dengue-2 capsid protein was evaluated in mice to determine the level 
      of protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenge and to measure the 
      cytotoxicity and cytokine-secretion profiles induced upon heterologous viral 
      stimulation. As a result, a significant protection rate was achieved after challenge 
      with lethal dengue-2 virus, which was dependent on CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells. In turn, 
      no protection was observed after heterologous challenge. In accordance, in 
      vitro-stimulated spleen cells from mice immunized with NLPs from the four dengue 
      serotypes showed a serotype-specific response of gamma interferon- and tumour 
      necrosis factor alpha-secreting cells. A similar pattern was detected when spleen 
      cells from dengue-immunized animals were stimulated with the capsid protein. Taking 
      these data together, we can assert that NLPs constitute an attractive vaccine 
      candidate against dengue. They induce a functional immune response mediated by 
      CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells in mice, which is protective against viral challenge. In 
      turn, they are potentially safe due to two important facts: induction of serotype 
      specific cell-mediated immunity and lack of induction of antiviral antibodies. 
      Further studies in non-human primates or humanized mice should be carried out to 
      elucidate the usefulness of the NLPs as a potential vaccine candidate against dengue 
      disease.

TI  - Diarrhea and dengue control in rural primary schools in Colombia: study protocol for 
      a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 182
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-13-182 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrheal diseases and dengue fever are major global health problems. 
      Where provision of clean water is inadequate, water storage is crucial. Fecal 
      contamination of stored water is a common source of diarrheal illness, but stored 
      water also provides breeding sites for dengue vector mosquitoes. Poor household 
      water management and sanitation are therefore potential determinants of both 
      diseases. Little is known of the role of stored water for the combined risk of 
      diarrhea and dengue, yet a joint role would be important for developing integrated 
      control and management efforts. Even less is known of the effect of integrating 
      control of these diseases in school settings. The objective of this trial was to 
      investigate whether interventions against diarrhea and dengue will significantly 
      reduce diarrheal disease and dengue entomological risk factors in rural primary 
      schools. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a 2×2 factorial cluster randomized controlled 
      trial. Eligible schools were rural primary schools in La Mesa and Anapoima 
      municipalities, Cundinamarca, Colombia. Eligible pupils were school children in 
      grades 0 to 5. Schools were randomized to one of four study arms: diarrhea 
      interventions (DIA); dengue interventions (DEN); combined diarrhea and dengue 
      interventions (DIADEN); and control (C). Schools were allocated publicly in each 
      municipality (strata) at the start of the trial, obviating the need for allocation 
      concealment. The primary outcome for diarrhea is incidence rate of diarrhea in 
      school children and for dengue it is density of adult female Aedes aegypti per 
      school. Approximately 800 pupils from 34 schools were enrolled in the trial with 
      eight schools in the DIA arm, nine in the DEN, eight in the DIADEN, and nine in the 
      control arms. The trial status as of June 2012 was: completed baseline data 
      collections; enrollment, randomization, and allocation of schools. The trial was 
      funded by the Research Council of Norway and the Lazos de Calandaima Foundation. 
      DISCUSSION: This is the first trial investigating the effect of a set of integrated 
      interventions to control both dengue and diarrhea. This is also the first trial to 
      study the combination of diarrhea-dengue disease control in school settings. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN40195031.

AB  - Plasma leakage in severe dengue has been postulated to be associated with skewed 
      cytokine immune responses. In this study, the association of cytokines with vascular 
      permeability in dengue patients was investigated. Human serum samples collected from 
      48 persons (13 with dengue fever, 29 with dengue hemorrhagic fever, and 6 healthy) 
      were subjected to cytokines analysis by using Luminex Multiplex Technology. Selected 
      serum samples from patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever sera and recombinant human 
      cytokines were then tested for roles on inducing vascular permeability by treatment 
      of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Confocal immunofluorescence staining 
      indicated morphologic alteration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated 
      with serum samples from patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever compared with serum 
      samples from healthy persons. The findings suggest that cytokines produced during 
      dengue hemorrhagic infections could induce alterations in the vascular endothelium, 
      which may play a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of dengue.

TI  - Diversity and composition of dengue virus type 2 in Venezuela.
PG  - 1816-22
LID - 10.1017/S0950268812002324 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by four closely related dengue virus 
      (genus Flavivirus)serotypes (DENV-1–4). The clinical outcomes vary from mild febrile 
      illness to life-threatening haemorrhagic manifestations. DENVs are endemic in the 
      tropics and subtropics globally and currently no specific treatment or vaccines are 
      available. In Venezuela, the American-Asian genotype of DENV-2 is the most prevalent 
      and has been associated with severe disease outcomes.We aimed to follow-up the 
      molecular epidemiology of DENV-2 in Venezuela to investigate if the evolution of the 
      virus has remained the same throughout time or if the same dynamics documented in 
      Brazil (hyperendemic co-circulation) also occurred. The results show that whereas 
      the epidemiology of DENV in several endemic areas is characterized by serotype 
      replacements through time, in Venezuela the American-Asian genotype DENV-2 has 
      evolved into several genetic lineages and has remained in hyperendemic 
      co-circulation with the other serotypes.

TI  - Potential distribution of dengue fever under scenarios of climate change and 
      economic development.
PG  - 448-54
LID - 10.1007/s10393-012-0808-0 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever is the most important viral vector-borne disease with ~50 million cases 
      per year globally. Previous estimates of the potential effect of global climate 
      change on the distribution of vector-borne disease have not incorporated the effect 
      of socioeconomic factors, which may have biased the results. We describe an 
      empirical model of the current geographic distribution of dengue, based on the 
      independent effects of climate and gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc, a proxy 
      for socioeconomic development). We use the model, along with scenario-based 
      projections of future climate, economic development, and population, to estimate 
      populations at risk of dengue in the year 2050. We find that both climate and GDPpc 
      influence the distribution of dengue. If the global climate changes as projected but 
      GDPpc remained constant, the population at risk of dengue is estimated to increase 
      by about 0.28 billion in 2050. However, if both climate and GDPpc change as 
      projected, we estimate a decrease of 0.12 billion in the population at risk of 
      dengue in 2050. Empirically, the geographic distribution of dengue is strongly 
      dependent on both climatic and socioeconomic variables. Under a scenario of constant 
      GDPpc, global climate change results in a modest but important increase in the 
      global population at risk of dengue. Under scenarios of high GDPpc, this adverse 
      effect of climate change is counteracted by the beneficial effect of socioeconomic 
      development.

TI  - Inhibition of cellular autophagy deranges dengue virion maturation.
PG  - 1312-21
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02177-12 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy is an important component of the innate immune response, directly 
      destroying many intracellular pathogens. However, some pathogens, including several 
      RNA viruses, subvert the autophagy pathway, or components of the pathway, to 
      facilitate their replication. In the present study, the effect of inhibiting 
      autophagy on the growth of dengue virus was tested using a novel inhibitor, 
      spautin-1 (specific and potent autophagy inhibitor 1). Inhibition of autophagy by 
      spautin-1 generated heat-sensitive, noninfectious dengue virus particles, revealing 
      a large effect of components of the autophagy pathway on viral maturation. A smaller 
      effect on viral RNA accumulation was also observed. Conversely, stimulation of 
      autophagy resulted in increased viral titers and pathogenicity in the mouse. We 
      conclude that the presence of functional autophagy components facilitates viral RNA 
      replication and, more importantly, is required for infectious dengue virus 
      production. Pharmacological inhibition of host processes is an attractive antiviral 
      strategy to avoid selection of treatment-resistant variants, and inhibitors of 
      autophagy may prove to be valuable therapeutics against dengue virus infection and 
      pathogenesis.

TI  - Estimating dengue vector abundance in the wet and dry season: implications for 
      targeted vector control in urban and peri-urban Asia.
PG  - 436-45
LID - 10.1179/2047773212Y.0000000063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research has shown that the classical Stegomyia indices (or "larval 
      indices") of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti reflect the absence or presence of the 
      vector but do not provide accurate measures of adult mosquito density. In contrast, 
      pupal indices as collected in pupal productivity surveys are a much better proxy 
      indicator for adult vector abundance. However, it is unknown when it is most optimal 
      to conduct pupal productivity surveys, in the wet or in the dry season or in both, 
      to inform control services about the most productive water container types and if 
      this pattern varies among different ecological settings. METHODS: A multi-country 
      study in randomly selected twelve to twenty urban and peri-urban neighborhoods 
      ("clusters") of six Asian countries, in which all water holding containers were 
      examined for larvae and pupae of Aedes aegypti during the dry season and the wet 
      season and their productivity was characterized by water container types. In 
      addition, meteorological data and information on reported dengue cases were 
      collected. FINDINGS: The study reconfirmed the association between rainfall and 
      dengue cases ("dengue season") and underlined the importance of determining through 
      pupal productivity surveys the "most productive containers types", responsible for 
      the majority (>70%) of adult dengue vectors. The variety of productive container 
      types was greater during the wet than during the dry season, but included 
      practically all container types productive in the dry season. Container types 
      producing pupae were usually different from those infested by larvae indicating that 
      containers with larval infestations do not necessarily foster pupal development and 
      thus the production of adult Aedes mosquitoes. CONCLUSION: Pupal productivity 
      surveys conducted during the wet season will identify almost all of the most 
      productive container types for both the dry and wet seasons and will therefore 
      facilitate cost-effective targeted interventions.

TI  - Phylogenetic reconstruction of dengue virus type 2 in Colombia.
PG  - 64
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-9-64 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is perhaps the most important viral re-emergent disease 
      especially in tropical and sub-tropical countries, affecting about 50 million people 
      around the world yearly. In Colombia, dengue virus was first detected in 1971 and 
      still remains as a major public health issue. Although four viral serotypes have 
      been recurrently identified, dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) has been involved in the 
      most important outbreaks during the last 20 years, including 2010 when the fatality 
      rate highly increased. As there are no major studies reviewing virus origin and 
      genotype distribution in this country, the present study attempts to reconstruct the 
      phylogenetic history of DENV-2 using a sequence analysis from a 224 bp PCR-amplified 
      product corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the envelope (E) gene from 48 
      Colombian isolates. RESULTS: As expected, the oldest isolates belonged to the 
      American genotype (subtype V), but the strains collected since 1990 represent the 
      American/Asian genotype (subtype IIIb) as previously reported in different American 
      countries. Interestingly, the introduction of this genotype coincides with the first 
      report of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Colombia at the end of 1989 and the increase 
      of cases during the next years. CONCLUSION: After replacement of the American 
      genotype, several lineages of American/Asian subtype have rapidly spread all over 
      the country evolving in new clades. Nevertheless, the direct association of these 
      new variants in the raise of lethality rate observed during the last outbreak has to 
      be demonstrated.

PG  - 500-3
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23218 [doi]
AB  - Eighty-one (71.7%) out of 113 patients had confirmed dengue infection (using ELISA 
      IgM serology) at Kassala, Eastern Sudan during the period of August through November 
      2010. According to the WHO criteria, dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever 
      (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) were observed in 30.9, 58, and 11.1% of these 
      patients, respectively. The mean age of these 81 patients was 25.5 years. 
      Male:female ratio was 1.8:1. Various symptoms including fever (100%), headache 
      (75.3%), vomiting (55.6%), nausea (53.1%), and backache (30.9%) were observed among 
      these patients. Thrombocytopenia (<100/10(9) platelets/L), and leucopenia (WBC count 
      <4,000 × 10(9) cells/L) and hemoconcentration (hematocrit >45) were reported in 
      86.4, 69.1, and 67.9% of the patients, respectively. High alanine aminotransferase 
      (ALT, >65 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST >37 U/L) were seen in 9.9 and 
      14.8% of the patients, respectively. There were five (6.1%) deaths, three of them 
      had DHF and the other two patients had DSS.

AB  - This study investigated anti-dengue serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies in a 
      random sample of dengue IgG-positive individuals identified in a survey performed in 
      a hyperendemic setting in northeastern Brazil in 2005. Of 323 individuals, 174 
      (53.8%) had antibodies to dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1), 104 (32.2%) to DENV-2 
      and 301 (93.2%) to DENV-3. Monotypic infections by DENV-3 were the most frequent 
      infection (35.6%). Of 109 individuals aged <15 years, 61.5% presented multitypic 
      infections. The force of infection estimated by a catalytic model was 0.9%, 0.4% and 
      2.5% person-years for DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3, respectively. By the age of 5 
      years, about 70%, 30% and 40% of participants were immune to DENV-3, DENV-2 and 
      DENV-1, respectively. The data suggest that infection with DENV-1, -2 and -3 is 
      intense at early ages, demonstrating the need for research efforts to investigate 
      dengue infection in representative population samples of Brazilian children during 
      early infancy.

TI  - Costs of dengue prevention and incremental cost of dengue outbreak control in 
      Guantanamo, Cuba.
PG  - 123-32
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2011.02881.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic cost of routine Aedes aegypti control in an 
      at-risk environment without dengue endemicity and the incremental costs incurred 
      during a sporadic outbreak. METHODS: The study was conducted in 2006 in the city of 
      Guantanamo, Cuba. We took a societal perspective to calculate costs in months 
      without dengue transmission (January-July) and during an outbreak (August-December). 
      Data sources were bookkeeping records, direct observations and interviews. RESULTS: 
      The total economic cost per inhabitant (p.i.) per month. (p.m.) increased from 2.76 
      USD in months without dengue transmission to 6.05 USD during an outbreak. In months 
      without transmission, the routine Aedes control programme cost 1.67 USD p.i. p.m. 
      Incremental costs during the outbreak were mainly incurred by the population and the 
      primary/secondary level of the healthcare system, hardly by the vector control 
      programme (1.64, 1.44 and 0.21 UDS increment p.i. p.m., respectively). The total 
      cost for managing a hospitalized suspected dengue case was 296.60 USD (62.0% direct 
      medical, 9.0% direct non-medical and 29.0% indirect costs). In both periods, the 
      main cost drivers for the Aedes control programme, the healthcare system and the 
      community were the value of personnel and volunteer time or productivity losses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Intensive efforts to keep A. aegypti infestation low entail important 
      economic costs for society. When a dengue outbreak does occur eventually, costs 
      increase sharply. In-depth studies should assess which mix of activities and actors 
      could maximize the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of routine Aedes control and 
      dengue prevention.

TI  - Underrecognized mildly symptomatic viremic dengue virus infections in rural Thai 
      schools and villages.
PG  - 389-98
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jis357 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The understanding of dengue virus (DENV) transmission dynamics and the 
      clinical spectrum of infection are critical to informing surveillance and control 
      measures. Geographic cluster studies can elucidate these features in greater detail 
      than cohort studies alone. METHODS: A 4-year longitudinal cohort and geographic 
      cluster study was undertaken in rural Thailand. Cohort children underwent 
      pre-/postseason serology and active school absence-based surveillance to detect 
      inapparent and symptomatic dengue. Cluster investigations were triggered by cohort 
      dengue and non-dengue febrile illnesses (positive and negative clusters, 
      respectively). RESULTS: The annual cohort incidence of symptomatic dengue ranged 
      from 1.3% to 4.4%. DENV-4 predominated in the first 2 years, DENV-1 in the second 2 
      years. The inapparent-to-symptomatic infection ratio ranged from 1.1:1 to 2.9:1. 
      Positive clusters had a 16.0% infection rate, negative clusters 1.1%. Of 119 
      infections in positive clusters, 59.7% were febrile, 20.2% were afebrile with other 
      symptoms, and 20.2% were asymptomatic. Of 16 febrile children detected during 
      cluster investigations who continued to attend school, 9 had detectable viremia. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Dengue transmission risk was high near viremic children in both high- 
      and low-incidence years. Inapparent infections in the cohort overestimated the rate 
      of asymptomatic infections. Ambulatory children with mild febrile viremic infections 
      could represent an important component of dengue transmission.

PG  - 122-4
AB  - Dengue fever has rarely been reported as an etiology for aplastic anemia. An 
      8-year-old girl was admitted with fever, myalgia and petechiae. Dengue virus IgM 
      antibodies were positive. She recovered completely, but her thrombocytopenia 
      persisted. Six weeks later she became pancytopenic. A bone marrow aspirate and 
      biopsy showed severe aplastic anemia. She was treated with antithymocytic 
      immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone and cyclosporine. She became transfusion 
      independent 6 months later. Dengue-virus induced aplastic anemia is a rare entity, 
      but it must be identified early for better outcome. Immunosuppressive therapy can 
      induce remission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue, a mosquito-borne febrile viral disease, is found in tropical and 
      sub-tropical regions and is now extending its range to temperate regions. The spread 
      of the dengue viruses mainly depends on vector population (Aedes aegypti and Aedes 
      albopictus), which is influenced by changing climatic conditions and various 
      land-use/land-cover types. Spatial display of the relationship between dengue vector 
      density and land-cover types is required to describe a near-future viral outbreak 
      scenario. This study is aimed at exploring how land-cover types are linked to the 
      behavior of dengue-transmitting mosquitoes. METHODS: Surveys were conducted in 92 
      villages of Phitsanulok Province Thailand. The sampling was conducted on three 
      separate occasions in the months of March, May and July. Dengue indices, i.e. 
      container index (C.I.), house index (H.I.) and Breteau index (B.I.) were used to map 
      habitats conducible to dengue vector growth. Spatial epidemiological analysis using 
      Bivariate Pearson's correlation was conducted to evaluate the level of 
      interdependence between larval density and land-use types. Factor analysis using 
      principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was performed to ascertain 
      the variance among land-use types. Furthermore, spatial ring method was used as to 
      visualize spatially referenced, multivariate and temporal data in single information 
      graphic. RESULTS: Results of dengue indices showed that the settlements around 
      gasoline stations/workshops, in the vicinity of marsh/swamp and rice paddy appeared 
      to be favorable habitat for dengue vector propagation at highly significant and 
      positive correlation (p = 0.001) in the month of May. Settlements around the 
      institutional areas were highly significant and positively correlated (p = 0.01) 
      with H.I. in the month of March. Moreover, dengue indices in the month of March 
      showed a significant and positive correlation (p <= 0.05) with deciduous forest. The 
      H.I. of people living around horticulture land were significantly and positively 
      correlated (p = 0.05) during the month of May, and perennial vegetation showed a 
      highly significant and positive correlation (p = 0.001) in the month of March with 
      C.I. and significant and positive correlation (p <= 0.05) with B.I., respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that gasoline stations/workshops, rice paddy, 
      marsh/swamp and deciduous forests played highly significant role in dengue vector 
      growth. Thus, the spatio-temporal relationships of dengue vector larval density and 
      land-use types may help to predict favorable dengue habitat, and thereby enables 
      public healthcare managers to take precautionary measures to prevent impending 
      dengue outbreak.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With approximately 2.5 billion people at risk, dengue is a major 
      international public health concern. Dengue vaccines currently in development should 
      help reduce the burden associated with this disease but the most efficient way of 
      using future dengue vaccines remains to be defined. Mathematical models of 
      transmission can provide insight into the expected impact of different vaccination 
      strategies at a population level and contribute to this definition. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: We developed and analyzed an age-structured, host-vector and 
      serotype-specific compartmental model, including seasonality. We first used this 
      transmission model to identify the immunological interactions between serotypes that 
      affect the risks and consequences of secondary infections (cross-protection, 
      increased susceptibility, increased severity, and increased infectiousness) and 
      reproduce the observed epidemiology of dengue. For populating this model, we used 
      routine surveillance data from Southern Vietnam and the results of a prospective 
      cohort study conducted in the same area. The model provided a good fit to the 
      observed data for age, severity of cases, serotype distribution, and dynamics over 
      time, using two scenarios of immunological interaction : short term cross-protection 
      alone (6-17 months) or a combination of short term cross-protection with 
      cross-enhancement (increased susceptibility, severity and infectiousness in the case 
      of secondary infections). Finally, we explored the potential impact of vaccination 
      for these two scenarios. Both highlighted that vaccination can substantially 
      decrease dengue burden by reducing the magnitude and frequency of outbreaks. 
      CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that seasonality and short term cross-protection are 
      key factors for explaining dengue dynamics in Southern Vietnam. Vaccination was 
      predicted to significantly reduce the disease burden, even in the situation where 
      immunological cross-enhancement affects the risks and consequences of secondary 
      infections.

AB  - Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne disease in the Philippines, especially 
      in Metropolitan Manila where communities are socially and economically diverse, and 
      city governments struggle to provide basic services such as continuously available, 
      piped water supply to residents. We examined responses to introducing water 
      container management to control dengue vectors in two diverse communities in 
      Masagana City: Village A (gated community) and Village B (informal settlers 
      community). The roll out of the intervention was carried out by the study team, 
      dengue control personnel and local health workers (BHWs). A behavioural change 
      framework was used to describe the community responses to the introduction of a new 
      vector control intervention - household water container management. Although, the 
      desired outcome was not achieved during the study's timeline, observation on 
      processes of behaviour change underscored the importance of understanding the social 
      nature of the urban communities, often overlooked structures when dengue control 
      program and researchers introduce new dengue control interventions.

PG  - 16-22
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0427 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is an acute febrile illness caused by four mosquito-borne dengue viruses 
      (DENV-1 to -4) that are endemic throughout the tropics. After returning from a 
      1-week missionary trip to Haiti in October of 2010, 5 of 28 (18%) travelers were 
      hospitalized for dengue-like illness. All travelers were invited to submit serum 
      specimens and complete questionnaires on pre-travel preparations, mosquito avoidance 
      practices, and activities during travel. DENV infection was confirmed in seven (25%) 
      travelers, including all travelers that were hospitalized. Viral sequencing revealed 
      closest homology to a 2007 DENV-1 isolate from the Dominican Republic. Although most 
      (88%) travelers had a pre-travel healthcare visit, only one-quarter knew that dengue 
      is a risk in Haiti, and one-quarter regularly used insect repellent. This report 
      confirms recent DENV transmission in Haiti. Travelers to DENV-endemic areas should 
      receive dengue education during pre-travel health consultations, follow mosquito 
      avoidance recommendations, and seek medical care for febrile illness during or after 
      travel.

AB  - We conducted a nationwide study at six tertiary hospitals from December 2008 through 
      November 2009 to investigate etiologies of febrile illnesses in Bangladesh. Febrile 
      patients meeting a clinical case definition were enrolled from inpatient and 
      outpatient medicine and pediatric units. We assessed 720 febrile patients over 12 
      months; 69 (9.6%) were positive for IgM antibodies against dengue virus by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and four malaria patients (0.56%) were confirmed 
      with immuno-chromatography and microscopic slide tests. We identified dengue cases 
      throughout the year from rural (49%) and urban areas (51%). We followed-up 55 
      accessible dengue-infected patients two months after their initial enrollment: 45 
      (82%) patients had fully recovered, 9 (16%) reported ongoing jaundice, fever and/or 
      joint pain, and one died. Dengue infection is widespread across Bangladesh, but 
      malaria is sufficiently uncommon that it should not be assumed as the cause of fever 
      without laboratory confirmation.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to estimate the effect that environmental, demographic, and 
      socioeconomic factors have on dengue mortality in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
      To that end, we conducted an observational ecological study, analyzing data 
      collected between 1995 and 2009. Dengue mortality rates were highest in the 
      Caribbean (Spanish-speaking and non-Spanish-speaking). Multivariate analysis through 
      Poisson regression revealed that the following factors were independently associated 
      with dengue mortality: time since identification of endemicity (adjusted rate ratio 
      [aRR] = 3.2 [for each 10 years]); annual rainfall (aRR = 1.5 [for each 10(3) 
      L/m(2)]); population density (aRR = 2.1 and 3.2 for 20-120 inhabitants/km(2) and > 
      120 inhabitants/km(2), respectively); Human Development Index > 0.83 (aRR = 0.4); 
      and circulation of the dengue 2 serotype (aRR = 1.7). These results highlight the 
      important role that environmental, demographic, socioeconomic, and biological 
      factors have played in increasing the severity of dengue in recent decades.

      Yogyakarta city, Indonesia. The aim of this study was to build an innovative 
      community-centered dengue-ecosystem management intervention in the city and to 
      assess the process and results. METHODS: For describing the baseline situation, 
      entomological surveys and household surveys were carried out in six randomly 
      selected neighborhoods in Yogyakarta city, documents were analyzed and different 
      stakeholders involved in dengue control and environmental management were 
      interviewed. Then a community-centered dengue-ecosystem management intervention was 
      built up in two of the neighborhoods (Demangan and Giwangan) whereas two 
      neighborhoods served as controls with no intervention (Tahunan and Bener). Six 
      months after the intervention follow up surveys (household interviews and 
      entomological) were conducted as well as focus group discussions and key informant 
      interviews. FIindings: The intervention results included: better community 
      knowledge, attitude and practices in dengue prevention; increased household and 
      community participation; improved partnership including a variety of stakeholders 
      with prospects for sustainability; vector control efforts refocused on environmental 
      and health issues; increased community ownership of dengue vector management 
      including broader community development activities such as solid waste management 
      and recycling. CONCLUSION: The community-centred approach needs a lot of effort at 
      the beginning but has better prospects for sustainability than the vertical 
      "top-down" approach.

AB  - The burden of dengue in Nicaragua has been steadily rising during the last three 
      decades; however, there have been few efforts to quantify the burden (measured in 
      disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]) and cost to society. Using primary data from 
      the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health (MINSA), the total cost and burden of dengue were 
      calculated from 1996 to 2010. Total costs included both direct costs from medical 
      expenditures and prevention activities and indirect costs from lost productivity. 
      The annual disease burden ranged from 99 to 805 DALYs per million, with a majority 
      associated with classic dengue fever. The total cost was estimated to be US$13.5 
      million/year (range: US$5.1-27.6 million). This analysis can help improve allocation 
      of dengue control resources in Nicaragua and the region. As one of the most 
      comprehensive analyses of its type to date in Nicaragua and Latin America, this 
      study can serve as a model to determine the burden and cost of dengue.

AB  - Dengue is an important arboviral disease of tropical and subtropical regions, with 
      significant morbidity and mortality. Dengue virus is antigenically classified into 
      four serotypes, which are further classified into 4-5 genotypes based on their 
      genetic diversity. Since genotypes vary in their virulence, their detection and 
      analysis of spatial and temporal transition are essential. We utilized sequence 
      information from the E-NS1 gene region for molecular and phylogenetic 
      characterization of dengue viruses isolated from dengue patients between 2007 and 
      2009. All four serotypes and multiple genotypes were detected, with predominance and 
      emergence of DENV-1 genotype V. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the emergence of 
      DENV-1 genotype V from India for the first time, which has replaced the earlier 
      circulating genotype III and genotype I. The circulation of multiple genotypes and 
      genotype replacement is critical, since genotypes vary in their virulence, and this 
      should be a point of concern for healthcare agencies.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of indigenous and imported dengue fever cases in Guangdong 
      province, China.
PG  - 132

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever has been a major public health concern in China since it 
      re-emerged in Guangdong province in 1978. This study aimed to explore spatiotemporal 
      characteristics of dengue fever cases for both indigenous and imported cases during 
      recent years in Guangdong province, so as to identify high-risk areas of the 
      province and thereby help plan resource allocation for dengue interventions. 
      METHODS: Notifiable cases of dengue fever were collected from all 123 counties of 
      Guangdong province from 2005 to 2010. Descriptive temporal and spatial analysis were 
      conducted, including plotting of seasonal distribution of cases, and creating 
      choropleth maps of cumulative incidence by county. The space-time scan statistic was 
      used to determine space-time clusters of dengue fever cases at the county level, and 
      a geographical information system was used to visualize the location of the 
      clusters. Analysis were stratified by imported and indigenous origin. RESULTS: 1658 
      dengue fever cases were recorded in Guangdong province during the study period, 
      including 94 imported cases and 1564 indigenous cases. Both imported and indigenous 
      cases occurred more frequently in autumn. The areas affected by the indigenous and 
      imported cases presented a geographically expanding trend over the study period. The 
      results showed that the most likely cluster of imported cases (relative risk = 7.52, 
      p < 0.001) and indigenous cases (relative risk = 153.56, p < 0.001) occurred in the 
      Pearl River Delta Area; while a secondary cluster of indigenous cases occurred in 
      one district of the Chao Shan Area (relative risk = 471.25, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study demonstrated that the geographic range of imported and indigenous dengue 
      fever cases has expanded over recent years, and cases were significantly clustered 
      in two heavily urbanised areas of Guangdong province. This provides the foundation 
      for further investigation of risk factors and interventions in these high-risk 
      areas.

      adults.
PG  - e1786
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001786 [doi]
LID - e1786
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue and chikungunya are co-circulating vector-borne diseases with 
      substantial overlap in clinical presentations. It is important to differentiate 
      between them during first presentation as their management, especially for dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF), is different. This study compares their clinical 
      presentation in Singapore adults to derive predictors to assist doctors in 
      diagnostic decision-making. METHODS: We compared 117 patients with chikungunya 
      infection diagnosed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
      with 917 dengue RT-PCR-positive adult patients (including 55 with DHF). We compared 
      dengue fever (DF), DHF, and chikungunya infections by evaluating clinical 
      characteristics of dengue and chikungunya; developing classification tools via 
      multivariate logistic regression models and classification trees of disease etiology 
      using clinical and laboratory factors; and assessing the time course of several 
      clinical variables. FINDINGS: At first presentation to hospital, significantly more 
      chikungunya patients had myalgia or arthralgia, and fewer had a sore throat, cough 
      (for DF), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia or tachycardia than 
      DF or DHF patients. From the decision trees, platelets <118 × 10(9)/L was the only 
      distinguishing feature for DF versus chikungunya with an overall correct 
      classification of 89%. For DHF versus chikungunya using platelets <100 × 10(9)/L and 
      the presence of bleeding, the overall correct classification was 98%. The time 
      course analysis supported platelet count as the key distinguishing variable. 
      INTERPRETATION: There is substantial overlap in clinical presentation between dengue 
      and chikungunya infections, but simple clinical and laboratory variables can predict 
      these infections at presentation for appropriate management.

AB  - The current dengue epidemic in Latin America represents a major threat to health. 
      However, surveillance of affected regions lacks timeliness and precision. We 
      investigated real-time electronic sources for monitoring spread of dengue into new 
      regions. This approach could provide timely estimates of changes in distribution of 
      dengue, a critical component of prevention and control efforts.

LID - 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.03038.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the space-time clustering of dengue fever (DF) transmission in 
      Bangladesh using geographical information system and spatial scan statistics 
      (SaTScan). METHODS: We obtained data on monthly suspected DF cases and deaths by 
      district in Bangladesh for the period of 2000-2009 from Directorate General of 
      Health Services. Population and district boundary data of each district were 
      collected from national census managed by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. To 
      identify the space-time clusters of DF transmission a discrete Poisson model was 
      performed using SaTScan software. RESULTS: Space-time distribution of DF 
      transmission was clustered during three periods 2000-2002, 2003-2005 and 2006-2009. 
      Dhaka was the most likely cluster for DF in all three periods. Several other 
      districts were significant secondary clusters. However, the geographical range of DF 
      transmission appears to have declined in Bangladesh over the last decade. 
      CONCLUSION: There were significant space-time clusters of DF in Bangladesh over the 
      last decade. Our results would prompt future studies to explore how social and 
      ecological factors may affect DF transmission and would also be useful for improving 
      DF control and prevention programs in Bangladesh.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Manaus, the capital city of the state of Amazon with nearly 2 million 
      inhabitants, is located in the middle of the Amazon rain forest and has suffered 
      dengue outbreaks since 1998. METHODS: In this study, blood samples were investigated 
      using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), aimed at identifying 
      dengue virus serotypes. RESULTS: Acute phase sera from 432 patients were tested for 
      the presence of dengue virus. Out of the 432 patients, 137 (31.3%) were found to be 
      positive. All the four dengue virus serotypes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      simultaneous circulation of the four dengue serotypes is described for the first 
      time in Manaus and in Brazil.

AB  - Dengue fever is one of the most important arthropod-borne viral diseases of public 
      health significance. It is endemic in most tropical and subtropical parts of the 
      world, many of which are popular tourist destinations. The presence of dengue 
      infection was examined in Iranian patients who were referred to the Arboviruses and 
      Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers Laboratory of the Pasteur Institute of Iran and tested 
      negative for Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) between 2000 and 2012. Serum 
      samples from these patients were tested for the presence of specific IgG and IgM and 
      viral nucleic acid in blood. Of the 300 sera tested, 15 (5%) were seropositive, and 
      3 (1%) were both serologically and PCR positive. Of the 15 seropositive cases, 8 
      (53.3%) had travelled to endemic areas including Malaysia (5, 62.5%), India (2, 25%) 
      and Thailand (1, 12.5%). In contrast, 7 (46.7%) of the cases had not reported 
      travelling abroad. Of these, six cases were from the Sistan and Baluchistan province 
      in southeast Iran and neighbouring Pakistan. Travellers play a key role in the 
      epidemiology of dengue infection in Iran and it is recommended that travellers to 
      endemic areas take precautionary measures to avoid mosquito bites.

TI  - Assessing the interest to participate in a dengue vaccine efficacy trial among 
      residents of Puerto Rico.
PG  - 905-15
LID - 10.4161/hv.20056 [doi]
AB  - Dengue, endemic in Puerto Rico, is a major public health problem. Vaccines are 
      thought the best means to prevent dengue because vector control alone has been 
      largely ineffective. We implemented qualitative studies in 2006 and 2010 to 
      determine the acceptability of conducting placebo-controlled dengue vaccine efficacy 
      trials in Puerto Rican children. Key informant interviews and focus groups with 
      parents and children were conducted in municipalities with high dengue incidence. We 
      used structured open-ended questions to determine motivators and attitudes regarding 
      vaccine trial participation. Knowledge about dengue risk and prevention, and 
      knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding vaccines and vaccine trials were 
      assessed. Using grounded theory, we conducted content analysis and established 
      categories and sub-categories of participant responses. All participants were 
      knowledgeable about dengue prevention and perceived children as most affected age 
      groups. Participants were aware of vaccines benefits and they thought a vaccine 
      could prevent dengue. However, most would not allow their children to participate in 
      a placebo-controlled vaccine trial. Barriers included lack of trust in new vaccines 
      and vaccine trial procedures; fear of developing dengue or side effects from the 
      vaccine and lack of information about candidate dengue vaccines. Participants 
      thought information, including results of previous trials might overcome barriers to 
      participation. Motivators for participation were altruism, protection from dengue, 
      free medical attention, and compensation for transportation and participation. 
      Parents would consider children participation if accurate vaccine trial information 
      is provided.

TI  - Novel antiviral activity of baicalein against dengue virus.
PG  - 214
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-12-214 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a serious arboviral disease currently with no effective 
      antiviral therapy or approved vaccine available. Therefore, finding the effective 
      compound against dengue virus (DENV) replication is very important. Among the 
      natural compounds, bioflavonoids derived mainly from plants are of interest because 
      of their biological and medicinal benefits. METHODS: In the present study, antiviral 
      activity of a bioflavonoid, baicalein, was evaluated against different stages of 
      dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) replication in Vero cells using focus forming unit 
      reduction assay and quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Baicalein inhibited DENV-2 
      replication in Vero cells with IC50= 6.46 μg/mL and SI= 17.8 when added after 
      adsorption to the cells. The IC50 against DENV-2 was 5.39 μg/mL and SI= 21.3 when 
      cells were treated 5 hours before virus infection and continuously up to 4 days post 
      infection. Baicalein exhibited direct virucidal effect against DENV-2 with IC 50= 
      1.55 μg/mL and showed anti-adsorption effect with IC50 = 7.14 μg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Findings presented here suggest that baicalein exerts potent antiviral activity 
      against DENV. Baicalein possesses direct virucidal activity against DENV besides its 
      effects against dengue virus adsorption and intracellular replication of DENV-2. 
      Baicalein, hence, should be considered for in vivo evaluation in the development of 
      an effective antiviral compound against DENV.

TI  - Factors associated with the spread of dengue fever in Jeddah Governorate, Saudi 
      Arabia.
PG  - 15-23
AB  - Dengue fever resurged sharply in Jeddah in 2004 and rose to 1308 cases in 2006. This 
      case-control study determined factors potentiating the spread of the disease to 
      provide an epidemiological baseline to help dengue control. All (650) suspected 
      cases of dengue in Jeddah in 2007 were eligible for inclusion. Cases were those 
      confirmed with dengue by laboratory investigations (n = 244) and controls those 
      confirmed negative (n = 406). Of these, 129 cases and 240 controls could be 
      contacted and were included in the study. Variables found significant in the 
      bivariate analysis were included in a logistic regression analysis. The presence of 
      stagnant water in indoor drainage holes (OR = 4.9), indoor larvae (OR = 2.2), nearby 
      construction sites (OR = 2.2), and older age (OR = 1.2) were independent 
      determinants of dengue infection (P<0.01 for all). Face-to-face health education 
      significantly decreased the risk of dengue infection. Efforts are needed to control 
      the modifiable factors identified in this study with emphasis on health education.

      manifestations are infrequently reported as clinical consequences of dengue 
      infection. Though severe dengue may be associated with meningoencephalitis, 
      meningitis is a rare initial presentation of otherwise uncomplicated dengue fever. 
      We report two adult patients who presented with fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity 
      without the typical symptoms of dengue infection. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis 
      showed lymphocytic pleocytosis in one and slight neutrophilic pleocytosis in the 
      other with a normal glucose value and negative bacterial cultures. Dengue was 
      suspected because thrombocytopenia was symptomatic in one patient and documented 
      during the hospital course, and was confirmed by demonstration of IgM antibody in 
      the cerebrospinal fluid samples specific for dengue in both cases. Our report 
      demonstrates that meningitis with or without encephalitis can be the first 
      manifestation of dengue infection. In endemic areas, dengue infection should be 
      considered as a probable etiological agent of meningitis. Regular monitoring of 
      platelet count can be an invaluable diagnostic screening tool. In appropriate 
      clinical settings detection of anti-dengue IgM both in serum and in CSF may lead to 
      correct diagnosis.

TI  - Prevalence of anti-dengue immunoglobulin G antibodies among American Red Cross blood 
      donors in Puerto Rico, 2006.
PG  - 1652-6

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is endemic in Puerto Rico and causes periodic outbreaks involving 
      thousands of persons. Seroprevalence studies among blood donors can provide useful 
      data on the immune status of the adult population. The objective of this study was 
      to determine the prevalence of anti-dengue immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies in a 
      random sample of blood donors to the American Red Cross (ARC) in Puerto Rico. STUDY 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Three-hundred randomly selected blood donations collected by the 
      ARC from February 1 to March 31, 2006, were tested using an anti-dengue IgG 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. One-third of the positive specimens were randomly 
      selected and tested by a microneutralization test (MNT) to determine the serotypes 
      of previous dengue infections. RESULTS: Most (84%) blood donors were male, and the 
      mean age was 44.6 years (range, 18-80 years). The prevalence (95% confidence 
      interval) of anti-dengue IgG antibodies was 92% (89%-95%). Of the 92 specimens 
      tested by the MNT, reactivity to all four dengue serotypes was observed and 96% were 
      secondary infections. The predominant serotype with the highest neutralization 
      titers, as identified by at least a fourfold higher titer compared to any other 
      serotype tested, was identified in 32 specimens; the most common predominant 
      serotypes identified by the MNT were DENV-3 and DENV-2 (63%). Recent infection with 
      DENV-1 was detected but, in 2005, routine surveillance did not detect any cases of 
      this serotype. CONCLUSION: Supplementary serologic testing of donated blood can 
      potentially provide information on the silent circulation or introduction of dengue 
      serotypes.

TI  - Assessing the temporal modelling for prediction of dengue infection in northern and 
      north-eastern, Thailand.
PG  - 339-48
AB  - This study aimed at developing a predicting model on the incidence rate of dengue 
      fever in four locations of Thailand--i.e. the northern region, Chiang Rai province, 
      the north-eastern region and Sisaket province--using time series analysis. Seasonal 
      Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was performed using data on 
      monthly incidence rate of dengue fever from 1981 to 2009, and validated using the 
      monthly rate collected for the period January 2010 to October 2011. The results show 
      that the SARIMA(1,0,1)(0,1,1)12 model is the most suitable model in all locations. 
      The model for all locations indicated that the predicted dengue incidence rate and 
      the actual dengue incidence rate matched reasonably well. The model was further 
      validated by the Portmanteau test with no significant autocorrelation between 
      residuals at different lag times. Our findings indicate that SARIMA model is a 
      useful tool for monitoring dengue incidence in Thailand. Furthermore, this model can 
      be applied to surveillance data for early warning systems for control and reduction 
      of dengue transmission.

TI  - Clinical presentation of dengue among patients admitted to the adult emergency 
      department of a tertiary care hospital in Martinique: implications for triage, 
      management, and reporting.
PG  - 42-50
LID - 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2011.08.010 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: During dengue epidemics, emergency physicians face large numbers of 
      patients with acute febrile illness. Triage algorithms and appropriate reporting 
      systems are useful to manage patients and prioritize resources. We identify possible 
      adaptations to these systems to improve the management of patients during epidemics. 
      METHODS: In a prospective observational study in the adult emergency department (ED) 
      of a tertiary care hospital, we enrolled all patients with febrile illness and a 
      confirmed diagnosis of dengue (ribonucleic acid identification). We then 
      retrospectively classified cases according to the initial clinical presentation at 
      the ED. RESULTS: We enrolled 715 patients (332 male patients), aged 14 to 91 years 
      (median 35 years). Severe illness was documented in 332 cases (46.4%) and was mostly 
      caused by serotype 2, or a secondary infection of any serotype. Severe forms 
      included dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome (104/332; 31.3%), severe 
      bleeding (9/332; 2.7%), and acute organ failure (56/332; 16.9%). The other patients 
      with severe illness (171/332; 51.5%) presented with symptoms of presyncope, intense 
      weakness, prolonged gastrointestinal symptoms, and hypotension. This presentation 
      was common during epidemics and appeared to be associated with dehydration and 
      electrolyte loss that improved markedly within 24 hours with saline solution 
      infusion. This group did not have evidence of plasma leakage, although similar 
      features were observed in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock 
      syndrome. CONCLUSION: Dengue has a wide range of clinical presentations in the ED. 
      Many patients who appear seriously ill on presentation will respond to intravenous 
      fluids.

TI  - Environmental influences on antibody-enhanced dengue disease outcomes.
PG  - 1021-9
LID - S0074-02762012000800010 [pii]
AB  - Because an enriched environment (EE) enhances T-cell activity and T-lymphocytes 
      contribute to immunopathogenesis during heterologous dengue virus (DENV) infections, 
      we hypothesised that an EE increases dengue severity. To compare single serotype 
      (SS) and antibody-enhanced disease (AED) infections regimens, serial intraperitoneal 
      were performed with DENV3 (genotype III) infected brain homogenate or anti-DENV2 
      hyperimmune serum followed 24 h later by DENV3 (genotype III) infected brain 
      homogenate. Compared AED for which significant differences were detected between the 
      EE and impoverished environmental (IE) groups (Kaplan-Meyer log-rank test, p = 
      0.0025), no significant differences were detected between the SS experimental groups 
      (Kaplan-Meyer log-rank test, p = 0.089). Survival curves from EE and IE animals 
      infected with the AED regimen were extended after corticoid injection and this 
      effect was greater in the EE than in the IE group (Kaplan-Meyer log-rank test, p = 
      0.0162). Under the AED regimen the EE group showed more intense clinical signs than 
      the IE group. Dyspnoea, tremor, hunched posture, ruffled fur, immobility, 
      pre-terminal paralysis, shock and death were associated with dominant T-lymphocytic 
      hyperplasia and presence of viral antigens in the liver and lungs. We propose that 
      the increased expansion of these memory T-cells and serotype cross-reactive 
      antibodies facilitates the infection of these cells by DENV and that these events 
      correlate with disease severity in an EE.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE(S): In 2008, the Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 
      Marnes-la-Coquette, France) was introduced to routine dengue diagnostics in Taiwan, 
      in addition to real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 
      virus isolation, and capture immunoglobulin (Ig)M/IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA). This study aimed to evaluate the benefit of this assay and factors 
      influencing the results of these diagnostic tests. METHODS: Retrospectively, the 
      authors enrolled laboratory-confirmed adult dengue patients from July 2008 to 
      January 2012 in a tertiary hospital. The sensitivities of each test alone and in 
      combination were analyzed by the duration of illness (early stage: day 0-day 3 and 
      late stage: day 4-day 8). The factors influencing sensitivity of the Dengue NS1 Ag 
      STRIP were examined. RESULTS: There were 392 patients enrolled. The overall 
      sensitivity of the Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP was 68.37% and PCR was 71.94%. With the 
      assistance of the Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP, a diagnosis was made in 10.97% of patients 
      without the need for second convalescent samples, and 4.34% more cases were 
      detected. Independent factors for reduced Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP sensitivity were 
      dengue virus (DENV) IgG seropositivity and a sample taken after the fifth day of 
      illness. At the early stage, the PCR and the Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP combination had the 
      highest sensitivity rate than other combinations. At the late stage, a combination 
      of the Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP and capture IgM/IgG ELISA had better sensitivity rates. 
      PCR and capture IgM/IgG ELISA in combination had sensitivity above 90% through the 
      course of illness. CONCLUSION: Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP is a useful tool for early dengue 
      diagnosis. Its use can increase the diagnostic sensitivity and decrease the need of 
      convalescent samples. Seeking treatment late (days postonset > 4) and DENV IgG 
      seropositivity independently decrease the sensitivity of the Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP.

TI  - Risk mapping of dengue in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
PG  - 21-5
AB  - Dengue fever is a recurring public health problem afflicting thousands of Malaysians 
      annually. In this paper, the risk map for dengue fever in the peninsular Malaysian 
      states of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur was modelled based on co-kriging and 
      geographical information systems. Using population density and rainfall as the 
      model's only input factors, the area with the highest risk for dengue infection was 
      given as Gombak and Petaling, two districts located on opposite sides of Kuala 
      Lumpur city that was also included in the risk assessment. Comparison of the 
      modelled risk map with the dengue case dataset of 2010, obtained from the Ministry 
      of Health of Malaysia, confirmed that the highest number of cases had been found in 
      an area centred on Kuala Lumpur as predicted our risk profiling.

AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne human illness worldwide. The ability to 
      predict disease severity during the earliest days of the illness is a long-sought, 
      but unachieved goal.We examined human genome-wide transcript abundance patterns in 
      daily peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 41 children hospitalized 
      with dengue virus (DENV) infection in Nicaragua, as well as 8 healthy control 
      subjects. Nine patients had primary dengue fever (DF1), 11 had dengue fever with 
      serologic evidence of prior DENV infection, i.e., secondary dengue fever (DF2), 12 
      had dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and 9 had dengue shock syndrome (DSS). We 
      identified 2,092 genes for which transcript abundance differed significantly between 
      patients on days 3-6 of fever and healthy subjects (FDR<1%). Prior DENV infection 
      explained the greatest amount of variation in gene expression among patients. The 
      number of differentially expressed genes was greatest on fever day 3 in patients 
      with DF1, while the number in patients with DF2 or DHF/DSS was greatest on day 5. 
      Genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and B cell differentiation were 
      expressed at higher levels, and genes associated with signal transduction and cell 
      adhesion were expressed at lower levels, in patients versus healthy controls. On 
      fever day 3, a set of interferon-stimulated gene transcripts was less abundant in 
      patients who subsequently developed DSS than in other patient groups (p<0.05, 
      ranksum). Patients who later developed DSS also had higher levels of transcripts on 
      day 3 associated with mitochondrial function (p<0.01, ranksum). These day 3 
      transcript abundance findings were not evident on subsequent fever days.In 
      conclusion, we identified differences in the timing and magnitude of human gene 
      transcript abundance changes in DENV patients that were associated with serologic 
      evidence of prior infection and with disease severity. Some of these differential 
      features may predict the outcome of DENV infection.

TI  - Acute pancreatitis in dengue hemorrhagic fever.
PG  - 57-61
AB  - We reported a case of acute pancreatitis as the complication of dengue hemorrhagic 
      fever (DHF). This complication can cause more severe fatal condition, and 
      difficulties in treatment, although it is rare. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is 
      one of the endemic diseases and often come as an outbreak event in South East Asia 
      including Indonesia. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a global public health 
      problem, because until now there has been no medicine to eradicate the dengue virus, 
      no dengue vaccine and difficult to eradicate the mosquitoes as the contagious 
      vector. Diagnosis and treatment of acute pancreatitis as early as possible is 
      important to improve the patient's condition and survival. The patient was a 59 year 
      old male and had been treated conservatively. The patient was admitted to the 
      hospital, oral fasting until the fourth day, given parenteral nutrition, antibiotic 
      and other intravenous medicines. Initial oral liquid diet was given on the fifth day 
      of hospitalization and changed gradually according to the condition. The patient was 
      then improved and discharged from the hospital.

PG  - 1244-51
LID - 10.1017/S095026881100183X [doi]
AB  - Our objective was to determine the association between temperature, humidity, 
      rainfall and dengue activity in Singapore, after taking into account lag periods as 
      well as long-term climate variability such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation Index 
      (SOI). We used a Poisson model which allowed for autocorrelation and overdispersion 
      in the data. We found weekly mean temperature and mean relative humidity as well as 
      SOI to be significantly and independently associated with dengue notifications. 
      There was an interaction effect by periods of dengue outbreaks, but periods where El 
      Niño was present did not moderate the relationship between humidity and temperature 
      with dengue notifications. Our results help to understand the temporal trends of 
      dengue in Singapore, and further reinforce the findings that meteorological factors 
      are important in the epidemiology of dengue.

TI  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever in an adult traveler returning to Japan.
PG  - 1779-82
AB  - We report the case of a Japanese traveler who developed dengue hemorrhagic fever 
      (DHF) with a probable secondary infection with dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). DHF 
      usually occurs in children, and rarely in adult travelers. Proper and timely 
      interventions can markedly reduce the mortality rate of DHF patients. The expansion 
      of endemic areas and increased frequency of travel to these areas may suggest 
      increased incidence of DHF in non-endemic areas in the near future. Early 
      recognition of reinfection with dengue virus and warning signs of circulatory 
      failure are crucial to prevent a severe shock state.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The occurrence of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is thought to result 
      from a complex interplay between the virus, host genetics and host immune factors. 
      Existing published data are not consistent, in part related to relatively small 
      sample sizes. We set out to determine possible associations between dengue virus 
      (DEN-V) NS3 specific T cells and cytokine and chemokine levels and the pathogenesis 
      of severe disease in a large cohort of individuals with DHF. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: By using ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot assays we determined DENV-NS3 specific 
      responses in patients with varying severity of DHF. Other cytokines produced by 
      DENV-NS3 specific T cells were determined by using multiple bead array analysis 
      (MBAA). We also determined the serum cytokine levels using MBAA, lymphocyte subsets 
      and Annexin V expression of lymphocytes in patients with varying severity of DHF. Of 
      the 112 DHF patients studied, 29 developed shock. Serum IL-10 and IP-10 levels 
      positively and significantly correlated with T cell apoptosis while IL-10 levels 
      inversely correlated with T cell numbers. In contrast, TGFß showed a very 
      significant (P<0.0001) and positive correlation (Spearman's R = 0.65) with the 
      platelet counts, consistent with platelet release. We found that whilst patients 
      with severe dengue had lower total T cell numbers, the DV-NS3 specific T cells 
      persisted and produced high levels of IFNγ but not TNFα, IL-3, IL-13, IL-2, IL-10 or 
      IL-17. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that serum IL-10, TNFα and TGFβ 
      differentially associate with dengue disease severity.

TI  - Airport sentinel surveillance and entry quarantine for dengue infections following a 
      fever screening program in Taiwan.
PG  - 182
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-12-182 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue has not reached an endemic status in Taiwan; nevertheless, we 
      have implemented a fever screening program at airports for the early detection of 
      febrile passengers with a dengue infection. This study is intended to assess the 
      performance of the airport screening procedures for dengue infection. METHODS: We 
      analyzed data from the national surveillance system of the Taiwan Centers for 
      Disease Control. We included the imported dengue cases reported by sentinel airports 
      and clinics as well as the domestic cases from 2007-2010. RESULTS: Approximately 
      44.9% (95%CI: 35.73-54.13%) of the confirmed imported dengue cases with an apparent 
      symptom (febrile) in the viremic stage were detected via the airport fever screening 
      program, with an estimated positive predictive value of 2.36% (95% CI: 0.96- 3.75%) 
      and a negative predictive value > 99.99%. Fluctuations in the number of the 
      symptomatic imported dengue cases identified in the airports (X) were associated 
      with the total number of imported dengue cases (Y) based on a regression analysis of 
      a biweekly surveillance (i.e., n = 104, R(2)(X:Y) = 0.61, P < 0.005). Additionally, 
      the fluctuating patterns in the cumulative numbers of the imported dengue cases (X) 
      with a 1-2 month lead time (t) was in parallel with that of the domestic dengue 
      cases (Y) based on a consecutive 4-year surveillance (i.e., n = 48, R(2)(X(t-1):Y) = 
      0.22, R(2)(X(t-2):Y) = 0.31, P < 0.001) from 2007-2010. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate 
      sensitivity of detecting dengue at the airports examined in this study indicated 
      some limitations of the fever screening program for the prevention of importation. 
      The screening program could assist in the rapid triage for self-quarantine of some 
      symptomatic dengue cases that were in the viremic stage at the borders and 
      contribute to active sentinel surveillance; however, the blocking of viral 
      transmission to susceptible populations (neighbors or family) from all of the 
      viremic travelers, including those with or without symptoms, is critical to prevent 
      dengue epidemics. Therefore, the reinforcement of mosquito bite prevention and 
      household vector control in dengue-endemic or dengue-competent hotspots during an 
      epidemic season is essential and highly recommended.

TI  - Virological surveillance of dengue in Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy, French West 
      Indies, using blood samples on filter paper.
PG  - 159-65
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0475 [doi]
AB  - To strengthen active dengue surveillance in Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy, two 
      French Caribbean islands, we evaluated the epidemiological usefulness of collecting 
      blood samples from NS1-positive dengue patients on filter paper to identify the 
      dengue serotypes circulating in these regions during a 27-month period. This 
      approach allowed dengue serotypes to be identified by reverse 
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 90.1% of the total set of 666 samples 
      analyzed and, in 95.5% of the samples collected during the acute phase of the 
      disease. This prospective virological surveillance using blood samples absorbed onto 
      filter paper, which were stored at 4°C and shipped at ambient temperature to a 
      specialized laboratory for analysis, allowed us to avoid the logistic and financial 
      costs associated with shipping frozen venous blood samples. This surveillance system 
      offers a low-cost alternative for reinforcing dengue prevention in areas where 
      specialized laboratories do not exist, notably by facilitating the early detection 
      of potentially new dengue serotypes.

PG  - e1784
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001784 [doi]
LID - e1784
AB  - The incidence of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever in Brazil experienced a 
      significant increase since the emergence of dengue virus type-3 (DENV-3) at the 
      early 2000s. Despite the major public health concerns, there have been very few 
      studies of the molecular epidemiology and time-scale of this DENV lineage in Brazil. 
      In this study, we investigated the origin and dispersion dynamics of DENV-3 genotype 
      III in Brazil by examining a large number (n=107) of E gene sequences sampled 
      between 2001 and 2009 from diverse Brazilian regions. These Brazilian sequences were 
      combined with 457 DENV-3 genotype III E gene sequences from 29 countries around the 
      world. Our phylogenetic analysis reveals that there have been at least four 
      introductions of the DENV-3 genotype III in Brazil, as signified by the presence of 
      four phylogenetically distinct lineages. Three lineages (BR-I, BR-II, and BR-III) 
      were probably imported from the Lesser Antilles (Caribbean), while the fourth one 
      (BR-IV) was probably introduced from Colombia or Venezuela. While lineages BR-I and 
      BR-II succeeded in getting established and disseminated in Brazil and other 
      countries from the Southern Cone, lineages BR-III and BR-IV were only detected in 
      one single individual each from the North region. The phylogeographic analysis 
      indicates that DENV-3 lineages BR-I and BR-II were most likely introduced into 
      Brazil through the Southeast and North regions around 1999 (95% HPD: 1998-2000) and 
      2001 (95% HPD: 2000-2002), respectively. These findings show that importation of 
      DENV-3 lineages from the Caribbean islands into Brazil seems to be relatively 
      frequent. Our study further suggests that the North and Southeast Brazilian regions 
      were the most important hubs of introduction and spread of DENV-3 lineages and 
      deserve an intense epidemiological surveillance.

TI  - Climatic factors influencing dengue cases in Dhaka city: a model for dengue 
      prediction.
PG  - 32-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Transmission of dengue virus depends on the presence of 
      Aedes mosquito. Mosquito generation and development is known to be influenced by the 
      climate. This study was carried out to examine whether the climatic factors data can 
      be used to predict yearly dengue cases of Dhaka city, Bangladesh. METHODS: Monthly 
      reported dengue cases and climate data for the years 2000-2008 were obtained from 
      the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and Meteorological Department of 
      Dhaka, Bangladesh, respectively. Data for the period 2000 to 2007 were used for 
      development of a model through multiple linear regressions. Retrospective validation 
      of the model was done with 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2008 data. Log transformation of the 
      dependent variable was done to normalize data for linear regression. Average monthly 
      humidity, rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature were used as independent 
      variables and number of dengue cases reported monthly was used as dependent 
      variable. Accuracy of the model for predicting outbreak was assessed through 
      receiver operative characteristics (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Climatic factors, i.e. 
      rainfall, maximum temperature and relative humidity were significantly correlated 
      with monthly reported dengue cases. The model incorporating climatic data of two-lag 
      month explained 61 per cent of variation in number of reported dengue cases and this 
      model was found to predict dengue outbreak (≥ 200 cases) with considerable accuracy 
      [area under ROC curve = 0.89, 95%CI = (0.89-0.98)]. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results showed that the climate had a major effect on the occurrence of dengue 
      infection in Dhaka city. Though the prediction model had some limitations in 
      predicting the monthly number of dengue cases, it could forecast possible outbreak 
      two months in advance with considerable accuracy.

AB  - Achievements in malaria control could inform efforts to control the increasing 
      global burden of dengue. Better methods for quantifying dengue endemicity-equivalent 
      to parasite prevalence surveys and endemicity mapping used for malaria-would help 
      target resources, monitor progress, and advocate for investment in dengue 
      prevention. Success in controlling malaria has been attributed to widespread 
      implementation of interventions with proven efficacy. An improved evidence base is 
      needed for large-scale delivery of existing and novel interventions for vector 
      control, alongside continued investment in dengue drug and vaccine development. 
      Control of dengue is unlikely to be achieved without coordinated international 
      financial and technical support for national programmes, which has proven effective 
      in reducing the global burden of malaria.

TI  - Changing pattern of dengue virus serotypes in Thailand between 2004 and 2010.
PG  - 366-70
AB  - Dengue virus infection is a major concern in several countries, and more than 50 
      million people are infected worldwide each year. Thailand is one of the countries 
      where people are susceptible to infection due to favourable geographical and 
      environmental conditions. In this retrospective study, we reported the changing 
      pattern of dengue virus serotypes during the period between 2004 and 2010. The 
      following percentage prevalence showed different serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) 
      predominant in respective years: DENV1 in 2004 (56.41%), DENV4 in 2007 (50%), DENV1 
      in 2008 (57.41%), and DENV3 in 2010 (38.7%). Moreover, the major serotypes were not 
      stable as they showed a shift from one serotype to another. We also found 
      co-infection with two different serotypes and reported the clinical manifestations, 
      which were not different from infection with a single serotype. Co-infection with 
      various serotypes may not necessarily cause more severe disease.

LID - e1002631
AB  - The female Aedes aegypti salivary gland plays a pivotal role in bloodmeal 
      acquisition and reproduction, and thereby dengue virus (DENV) transmission. It 
      produces numerous immune factors, as well as immune-modulatory, vasodilatory, and 
      anti-coagulant molecules that facilitate blood-feeding. To assess the impact of DENV 
      infection on salivary gland physiology and function, we performed a comparative 
      genome-wide microarray analysis of the naïve and DENV infection-responsive A. 
      aegypti salivary gland transcriptomes. DENV infection resulted in the regulation of 
      147 transcripts that represented a variety of functional classes, including several 
      that are essential for virus transmission, such as immunity, blood-feeding, and 
      host-seeking. RNAi-mediated gene silencing of three DENV infection-responsive 
      genes--a cathepsin B, a putative cystatin, and a hypothetical ankyrin 
      repeat-containing protein--significantly modulated DENV replication in the salivary 
      gland. Furthermore, silencing of two DENV infection-responsive odorant-binding 
      protein genes (OBPs) resulted in an overall compromise in blood acquisition from a 
      single host by increasing the time for initiation of probing and the probing time 
      before a successful bloodmeal. We also show that DENV established an extensive 
      infection in the mosquito's main olfactory organs, the antennae, which resulted in 
      changes of the transcript abundance of key host-seeking genes. DENV infection, 
      however, did not significantly impact probing initiation or probing times in our 
      laboratory infection system. Here we show for the first time that the mosquito 
      salivary gland mounts responses to suppress DENV which, in turn, modulates the 
      expression of chemosensory-related genes that regulate feeding behavior. These 
      reciprocal interactions may have the potential to affect DENV transmission between 
      humans.

LID - 10.1128/JVI.06796-11 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) affects millions of people, causing more than 20,000 deaths 
      annually. No effective treatment for the disease caused by DENV infection is 
      currently available, partially due to the lack of knowledge on the basic aspects of 
      the viral life cycle, including the molecular basis of the interaction between viral 
      components and cellular compartments. Here, we characterized the properties of the 
      interaction between the DENV capsid (C) protein and hepatic lipid droplets (LDs), 
      which was recently shown to be essential for the virus replication cycle. Zeta 
      potential analysis revealed a negative surface charge of LDs, with an average 
      surface charge of -19 mV. The titration of LDs with C protein led to an increase of 
      the surface charge, which reached a plateau at +13.7 mV, suggesting that the viral 
      protein-LD interaction exposes the protein cationic surface to the aqueous 
      environment. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based force spectroscopy measurements 
      were performed by using C protein-functionalized AFM tips. The C protein-LD 
      interaction was found to be strong, with a single (un)binding force of 33.6 pN. This 
      binding was dependent on high intracellular concentrations of potassium ions but not 
      sodium. The inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in DENV-infected cells resulted in the 
      dissociation of C protein from LDs and a 50-fold inhibition of infectious virus 
      production but not of RNA replication, indicating a biological relevance for the 
      potassium-dependent interaction. Limited proteolysis of the LD surface impaired the 
      C protein-LD interaction, and force measurements in the presence of specific 
      antibodies indicated that perilipin 3 (TIP47) is the major DENV C protein ligand on 
      the surface of LDs.

TI  - Autoimmune features caused by dengue fever: a case report.
PG  - 92-5
AB  - Dengue virus is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. 
      Co-circulation of the four types of dengue viruses and expansion of dengue epidemic 
      gave rise to infection enhancement and a big expansion of clinical aspects of the 
      disease. Herein we report a case of a 25-year-old white woman with dengue fever and 
      numerous associated autoimmune features. Our patient had proteinuria, an extensive 
      right pleural effusion, a thin pericardial effusion and ascites. She had a low C3 
      level and positive antinuclear antibody; cryoglobulins were also positive. The 
      numerous autoimmune features of this patient were a diagnostic challenge, since she 
      was a young woman and could be easily mistaken for a rheumatologic patient in a 
      newly open disease. Dengue infection probably was a triggering event causing an 
      abnormal immune response. Therefore, dengue should be suspected in patients with 
      hematological disorders and autoimmune features in endemic regions or those who have 
      travelled to those regions.

AB  - The objective of this study was to study the spectrum of neurological manifestations 
      in patients with dengue infection. This was a prospective study undertaken at the 
      Departments of Medicine and Neurology, Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, India. 
      All patients diagnosed with dengue fever during an epidemic (1 September 2010-31 
      December 2010) were screened for neurological manifestations. There were a total of 
      799 patients with dengue infection. Neurological manifestations were present in 21 
      (2.63%), 19 of whom were men with a mean age of 33.7 ± 13.9 years. The neurological 
      diagnoses were hypokalaemia with: quadriparesis (7); myositis (4); encephalopathy 
      (4); Guillain-Barre syndrome (2); acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (2); 
      lumbosacral plexopathy (1); and intracranial haemorrhage (1). Three of these 
      patients died. Clinicians should be aware that neurological manifestations in dengue 
      fever are not uncommon.

TI  - Severe nonfebrile dengue infection in an adolescent after postoperative kidney 
      transplantation: a case report.

LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.11.025 [doi]
AB  - We herein have reported a case of severe nonfebrile dengue infection complicated 
      with refractory pancytopenia and a large perinephric hematoma with shock in a 
      16-year-old adolescent during the early postoperative period after kidney 
      transplantation. After the diagnosis of end-stage renal disease she underwent 
      living-related kidney transplantation. Thirteen days after successful 
      transplantation, she exhibited a notable amount of ascites, bilateral pleural 
      effusions, thrombocytopenia, and increased hemoglobin without pre-existent fever. 
      Further investigation revealed positive dengue nonstructural protein 1 antigen 
      (dengue NS1 Ag) and dengue virus serotype 1 by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the patient's serum. She exhibited hemophagocytic 
      syndrome, manifested by refractory pancytopenia and refractory anemia resulting in 
      hypovolemic shock and acute graft failure on day 28 posttransplantation. The anemia 
      was attributed to a large hematoma around the transplanted kidney requiring surgical 
      evacuation of clotted blood. Postoperatively, she gradually recovered with 
      resolution of thrombocytopenia and excellent graft function. Persistent dengue 
      antigenemia and viremia was shown by dengue NS1 Ag and RT-PCR of dengue serotype-1. 
      The viremia was present longer than the dengue antigenemia. Dengue-specific 
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed the 
      primary dengue infection and evidence of a recent donor dengue infection.

TI  - Geographical distribution and spatio-temporal patterns of dengue cases in Jeddah 
      Governorate from 2006-2008.
PG  - 23-9
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/trs011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue remains a major health problem in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A 
      surveillance system was initiated to detect new cases in 2006. The study aims to 
      examine these data for detection of space-time clustering and identify target areas 
      for effective interventions. METHODS: Through a cross-sectional design, we included 
      all confirmed dengue cases among residents of Jeddah with a clearly written 
      addresses (n = 2288). Cases were geo-coded at the district level, and then analyzed 
      by ArcGIS for geographical distribution and by the space-time permutation model of 
      SaTScan for detection of clusters of cases. RESULTS: This study showed a seasonal 
      pattern of dengue infections mainly in the first half of the year. Males and younger 
      age-groups were more likely to be affected (70.8 and 67.3%, respectively). 
      Descriptive spatial analysis showed that the infection was concentrated in the south 
      and central-north regions. Space-time permutation scan statistics demonstrated five 
      spatio-temporal clusters of dengue cases with no variations by age-groups, gender 
      and nationality-group. Our results showed clear geographical patterns of dengue in 
      Jeddah. CONCLUSIONS: Our unique data with geographical coding enabled us to detect 
      and target dengue clusters that support the use of geospatial information in 
      infection control in Saudi Arabia and would allow for better targeting of 
      interaction progress.

TI  - Phylogeography and population dynamics of dengue viruses in the Americas.
PG  - 1533-43
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msr320 [doi]
AB  - Changes in Dengue virus (DENV) disease patterns in the Americas over recent decades 
      have been attributed, at least in part, to repeated introduction of DENV strains 
      from other regions, resulting in a shift from hypoendemicity to hyperendemicity. 
      Using newly sequenced DENV-1 and DENV-3 envelope (E) gene isolates from 11 Caribbean 
      countries, along with sequences available on GenBank, we sought to document the 
      population genetic and spatiotemporal transmission histories of the four main 
      invading DENV genotypes within the Americas and investigate factors that influence 
      the rate and intensity of DENV transmission. For all genotypes, there was an initial 
      invasion phase characterized by rapid increases in genetic diversity, which 
      coincided with the first confirmed cases of each genotype in the region. Rapid 
      geographic dispersal occurred upon each genotype's introduction, after which 
      individual lineages were locally maintained, and gene flow was primarily observed 
      among neighboring and nearby countries. There were, however, centers of viral 
      diversity (Barbados, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Suriname, Venezuela, and Brazil) that 
      were repeatedly involved in gene flow with more distant locations. For DENV-1 and 
      DENV-2, we found that a "distance-informed" model, which posits that the intensity 
      of virus movement between locations is inversely proportional to the distance 
      between them, provided a better fit than a model assuming equal rates of movement 
      between all pairs of countries. However, for DENV-3 and DENV-4, the more stochastic 
      "equal rates" model was preferred.

LID - S1415-790X2012000400008 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cuiaba presents a huge number of cases of dengue in the endemic 
      periods as well as in the cyclical epidemics. The aim of the study was to analyze 
      the intra-urban differentials of the incidence in 2007 and 2008 relating them with 
      socio-economical and environmental life conditions. METHOD: study of ecological 
      approach using secondary data. The characterization of the life conditions was 
      gotten from the Demographic Census (IBGE, 2000) and the epidemiologic data from the 
      Surveillance National System (SINAN). The socio-economical index was based on school 
      level and income of the head of family and overcrowding; the socioambiental index 
      used information about sanitation and proportion of precarious domiciles. The 
      variables were classified in quintis and points were attributed for each one. The 
      score for neighborhood was resultant of the addition of the points for each 
      variable. The neighborhoods had been classified in stratus of risk from the 
      combination of results of the two indexes. RESULTS: The incidence was lesser in 
      stratus of average and low risk and very high in the stratum of the highest risk but 
      was bigger then expected in the stratum classified at minimum risk indicating 
      dissociation between life conditions and occurrence of the illness. CONCLUSION: 
      Higher incidences of the dengue fever in Cuiaba in 2007 and 2008 have been observed 
      in places with precarious conditions of sanitation and inhabited by populations with 
      lesser level of income and education level but there is no linear correlation 
      between life conditions and incidence.

AB  - We present our surveillance results on imported dengue cases in Taiwan during 
      2008-2010. A total of 734 imported dengue patients were identified. The travelers 
      were arriving from 18 countries, including Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, 
      South Pacific islands, and Latin America. Gene sequences from 358 dengue virus 
      (DENV) isolates were used to perform phylogenetic analyses, thus, providing an 
      updated view of the geographic distribution and dynamic transmission of DENV strains 
      circulating in these countries. Our results suggest that the DENV-1 genotype I and 
      DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype comprise the predominant DENV strains circulating in 
      Southeast Asian countries. The DENV-3 Genotype III strain was found to be newly 
      emerging in several Southeast Asian countries, however, the Asian genotype 2 and the 
      Asian/American genotype of DENV-2 strains appeared to be less prevalent in Southeast 
      Asia. Furthermore, imported dengue viruses are representative of the overall 
      patterns of serotype/genotype frequencies of dengue outbreaks that occurred in 
      Taiwan.

TI  - Dengue nonstructural protein-1 status is not associated to circulating levels of 
      interleukin-17, C-reactive protein and complement in children with acute dengue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During dengue infection increase in plasma level of various substances 
      have been reported. Some of those molecules are related to the virus biology and 
      others result of the interaction virus-host. Nonstructural protein-1 (NS1) secreted 
      by dengue virus has been reported to have a role in dengue pathogenesis. NS1 is 
      capable of interacting with complement to evade viral clearance. However, there is 
      little information about the presence of serum NS1 and the levels of other molecules 
      related to dengue pathogenesis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine 
      the association of the NS1 status and the circulating levels of interleukin-17 
      (IL-17), C-reactive protein (CRP), C3 and C4 in acute dengue. STUDY DESIGN: In this 
      study the serum presence of NS1, IL-17, CRP, C3 and C4 was determined in children 
      with acute dengue. IL-17, CRP, anti dengue-IgG content was measured by ELISA, C3 and 
      C4 levels by an immunoturbidimetric assay and NS1 by an immunochromatographic assay. 
      RESULTS: All patients were positive for dengue infection as shown by antibodies 
      anti-dengue and/or virus isolation. Increased levels of IL-17, CRP and C4 no related 
      to the presence of NS1 were found in the patients. Values of C3 remained similar to 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that NS1 does not module the 
      production of studied molecules during dengue infection.

TI  - A data-driven epidemiological prediction method for dengue outbreaks using local and 
      remote sensing data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most common arboviral disease of humans, with more than 
      one third of the world's population at risk. Accurate prediction of dengue outbreaks 
      may lead to public health interventions that mitigate the effect of the disease. 
      Predicting infectious disease outbreaks is a challenging task; truly predictive 
      methods are still in their infancy. METHODS: We describe a novel prediction method 
      utilizing Fuzzy Association Rule Mining to extract relationships between clinical, 
      meteorological, climatic, and socio-political data from Peru. These relationships 
      are in the form of rules. The best set of rules is automatically chosen and forms a 
      classifier. That classifier is then used to predict future dengue incidence as 
      either HIGH (outbreak) or LOW (no outbreak), where these values are defined as being 
      above and below the mean previous dengue incidence plus two standard deviations, 
      respectively. RESULTS: Our automated method built three different fuzzy association 
      rule models. Using the first two weekly models, we predicted dengue incidence three 
      and four weeks in advance, respectively. The third prediction encompassed a 
      four-week period, specifically four to seven weeks from time of prediction. Using 
      previously unused test data for the period 4-7 weeks from time of prediction yielded 
      a positive predictive value of 0.686, a negative predictive value of 0.976, a 
      sensitivity of 0.615, and a specificity of 0.982. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a 
      novel approach for dengue outbreak prediction. The method is general, could be 
      extended for use in any geographical region, and has the potential to be extended to 
      other environmentally influenced infections. The variables used in our method are 
      widely available for most, if not all countries, enhancing the generalizability of 
      our method.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A. aegypti production and human density may vary considerably in dengue 
      endemic areas. Understanding how interactions between these factors influence the 
      risk of transmission could improve the effectiveness of the allocation of vector 
      control resources. To evaluate the combined impacts of variation in A. aegypti 
      production and human density we integrated field data with simulation modeling. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using data from seven censuses of A. aegypti pupae 
      (2007-2009) and from demographic surveys, we developed an agent-based transmission 
      model of the dengue transmission cycle across houses in 16 dengue-endemic urban 
      'patches' (1-3 city blocks each) of Armenia, Colombia. Our field data showed that 
      92% of pupae concentrated in only 5% of houses, defined as super-producers. Average 
      secondary infections (R(0)) depended on infrequent, but highly explosive 
      transmission events. These super-spreading events occurred almost exclusively when 
      the introduced infectious person infected mosquitoes that were produced in 
      super-productive containers. Increased human density favored R(0), and when the 
      likelihood of human introduction of virus was incorporated into risk, a strong 
      interaction arose between vector production and human density. Simulated 
      intervention of super-productive containers was substantially more effective in 
      reducing dengue risk at higher human densities. SIGNIFICANCE/CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results show significant interactions between human population density and the 
      natural regulatory pattern of A. aegypti in the dynamics of dengue transmission. The 
      large epidemiological significance of super-productive containers suggests that they 
      have the potential to influence dengue viral adaptation to mosquitoes. Human 
      population density plays a major role in dengue transmission, due to its potential 
      impact on human-A. aegypti contact, both within a person's home and when visiting 
      others. The large variation in population density within typical dengue endemic 
      cities suggests that it should be a major consideration in dengue control policy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicohematological profile and the platelet trends in 
      children presenting with dengue infection during the 2010 dengue epidemic in north 
      India and to compare the it with previous epidemics. METHODS: This retrospective 
      study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital of North India. Of the 219 
      children admitted from August 2010 through November 2010 with suspected dengue 
      infection, 135 were IgM positive and were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: 
      These children were further categorized as dengue fever (8%), dengue hemorrhagic 
      fever (51%) and dengue shock syndrome (42%). The mean age (± SD) of children were 
      8.3 ± 3.5 y with male: female ratio 1.32. Mean duration of fever (±SD) was 6.3 
      d ± 3.7 d. The clinical features included fever (100%), headache (63%), abdominal 
      pain (71%), petechia (35.5%), rash (26.6%) and bleeding manifestations (48.8%). On 
      examination, Hess test (33.3%), signs of fluid retention (23%), pallor (13.3%),signs 
      of circulatory failure (43%), hepatomegaly (31.1%) and splenomegaly (27%) were 
      positive. Laboratory investigations revealed mean (±SD) hemoglobin 11.5 g/dl (±1.7), 
      hematocrit 36.1(±5.5), leucocyte count 7,551/mm(3) and platelet count 38,800 mm(3) 
      on day of admission. A total of 92.6% of children had thrombocytopenia and 19.2% had 
      abnormal leucocyte count. Deranged liver function tests were observed in 48 
      children. The mean (±SD) of hospitalization and platelet recovery were 4.2 ± 2.3 d 
      and 3.6 ± 1.3 d respectively and did not vary according to disease category 
      (P > 0.05). Bleeding manifestations were not related to platelet count (P > 0.05). 
      There was no statistical difference in the demographic, clinical or laboratory 
      observations according to disease category (P > 0.05). A total of 24 children had 
      evidence of other co-infections and four had atypical complications. Dengue 2 virus 
      was the strain reported in most of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed shift 
      to higher age of presentation, more number of dengue hemorrhagic fever and 
      associated co-infections in children. The complications and mortality was low and 
      platelet recovery time was not influenced by disease category.

TI  - Differential diagnosis of Chikungunya, dengue viral infection and other acute 
      febrile illnesses in children.
PG  - 459-63
LID - 10.1097/INF.0b013e31824bb06d [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical manifestations of chikungunya (CHIK) are similar to those of 
      dengue. It would be useful to be able to identify clinical manifestations that could 
      reliably help to differentiate CHIK from dengue and other acute febrile illnesses 
      during a CHIK outbreak in a dengue-endemic area. METHODS: A prospective cohort study 
      was conducted between April and July 2009 in children aged 1 month to 15 years who 
      lived in a CHIK outbreak area in southern Thailand and who had fever <7 days with 
      arthralgia/arthritis, myalgia or rash. CHIK was confirmed by real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction or the indirect immunofluorescence test. RESULTS: Fifty patients were 
      suspected of having CHIK, of whom 32 were confirmed, 1 had coinfection with dengue 
      viral infection (DVI), 10 had dengue alone and 7 had an acute febrile illness. The 
      specificity and positive predictive value of fever and arthralgia together to 
      diagnose CHIK were 47.1% and 74.2%, and the corresponding values of the standard 
      clinical triad (fever, arthralgia, rash) were 70.6% and 83.3%, respectively. Fever ≤ 
      2 days, skin rash during fever and white blood cell count ≥ 5000 cells/mm(3) were 
      independently and significantly associated with CHIK in comparison with DVI and 
      acute febrile illnesses, with relative risk ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 
      10.4 (0.9-116) and 13.7 (1.3-145), 13.8 (1.2-164) and 14.8 (1.6-168), and 18.3 
      (1.7-194) and 1.8 (0.1-20.6), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: During a CHIK outbreak in a 
      DVI-endemic area, overdiagnosis of CHIK was common. Skin rash during fever and white 
      blood cell count ≥ 5000 cells/mm(3) or specific antigen testing (if available) can 
      be helpful in differentiating CHIK from DVI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) nucleic acid amplification testing of blood 
      donations during epidemics in endemic locations, including Puerto Rico, has 
      suggested possible sizable transfusion transmission risk. Estimates of the long-term 
      prevalence of DENV viremic donations will help evaluate the potential magnitude of 
      this risk in Puerto Rico. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Estimates of the prevalence of 
      DENV viremia in the Puerto Rican population at large from 1995 through 2010 were 
      derived from dengue case reports and their onset dates obtained from islandwide 
      surveillance, estimates of case underreporting, and extant data on the duration of 
      DENV viremia and the unapparent-to-apparent dengue infection ratio. Under the 
      assumptions that viremia prevalence in blood donors was similar to that of the 
      population at large and that symptomatic persons do not donate, statistical 
      resampling methods were used to estimate the prevalence of dengue viremia in blood 
      donations. RESULTS: Over the 16-year period, the maximum and mean daily prevalences 
      of dengue viremia (per 10,000) in blood donations in Puerto Rico were estimated at 
      45.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.5-55.4) and 7.0 (95% CI, 3.9-10.1), 
      respectively. Prevalence varied considerably by season and year. CONCLUSION: These 
      data suggest a substantial prevalence of DENV viremia in Puerto Rican blood 
      donations, particularly during outbreaks.

AB  - Dengue fever (DF) remains one of the most important emerging infectious diseases. 
      Whereas DF is well recognized in endemic countries, there are indications that the 
      disease is underdiagnosed among travellers to endemic regions. Here, we present the 
      first descriptive survey on cases of travel-acquired DF imported to Denmark 
      diagnosed at the national reference laboratory for dengue virus diagnostics during a 
      9-year period. In our study, 16 - 46 travel-acquired dengue virus infections were 
      diagnosed per year. DF is mainly imported by adults, mostly men, returning from 
      Southeast Asian countries. The minimum incidence of dengue virus infection among 
      Danish travellers is estimated to be 4.9 per 100,000 travellers. Our results confirm 
      and expand studies from other European countries, and underline the importance of 
      surveillance based on relevant diagnostic analyses.

TI  - XAF1 contributes to dengue virus-induced apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells.
PG  - 1062-73

AB  - The mechanism of vascular leakage in severe dengue infection remains unclear. Here, 
      we used primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the EA.hy926 
      cell line to study the molecular events that occur after dengue virus serotype 2 
      (DENV2) infection. DENV2-induced apoptosis was confirmed using nuclear staining, 
      TUNEL assay, and electron microscopy. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis was 
      performed using a microarray of DENV2-infected HUVECs. Notably, interferon-inducible 
      genes were differentially expressed after DENV2 infection. Prominent among these 
      genes was the X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)-associated 
      factor 1 (XAF1; up-regulated 1.2-fold in the microarray analysis and ∼8-fold by 
      qRT-PCR after DENV2 infection). XAF1 protein levels were up-regulated after DENV2 
      infection in both HUVECs and EA.hy926 cells. Evidence indicated interaction between 
      XAF1 and XIAP during DENV2 infection based on their cellular localization, as 
      observed by confocal microscopy and the coimmunoprecipitation of XIAP with an 
      anti-XAF1 antibody. Next, recombinant EA.hy926 cell lines in which XAF1 was either 
      knocked down or overexpressed were constructed. The expression levels of the 
      apoptosis-related genes caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, and poly-(ADP-ribose) 
      polymerase (PARP) were down-regulated in the XAF1 knockdown (24-48 h postinfection) 
      but were up-regulated in XAF1 overexpressing cells (36 h postinfection). This is the 
      first study of the role of XAF1 in promoting apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells 
      after DENV2 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most important arboviral disease in the world. Dengue 
      viruses (DENVs) have produced huge outbreaks in Brazil in the past 25 years with 
      more than 5 million reported cases. During these epidemics, asymptomatic individuals 
      infected with DENV could donate blood and serve as a source of virus dissemination 
      in the community. Here, we studied the circulation of DENV in healthy individuals 
      during an epidemic outbreak. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 500 serum 
      samples from healthy blood donors collected at the Hemotherapy Center of Ribeirão 
      Preto, Brazil, during a dengue outbreak. The presence of DENV RNA in the serum 
      samples was screened by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR). The virus serotype was determined by a heminested PCR procedure. A partial 
      fragment of the NS5 gene sequence was used for phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: DENV 
      RNA was detected in the serum sample of 2 of 500 (0.4%) individuals. Both of them 
      were infected with DENV-3 Genotype III, a virus that has been circulating in Brazil 
      in the past decade. CONCLUSION: Individuals with asymptomatic DENV infection can be 
      blood donors and serve as a source of virus dissemination in the community. Further 
      studies are needed to determine the risk of recipient infection by DENV as a result 
      of transfusion in Brazil, especially during epidemic periods.

AB  - Dengue virus immune protection is specific to the serotype encountered and is 
      thought to persist throughout one's lifetime. Many serotype cross-reactive memory B 
      cells isolated from humans with previous dengue infection are specific for the 
      nonstructural and the prM structural viral proteins, and they can enhance infection 
      in vitro. However, plasmablasts circulating in enormous numbers during acute 
      secondary infection have not been studied. In this study, we analyzed single 
      plasmablasts from two patients by sorting the cells for Ig sequence analysis and for 
      recombinant expression of Abs. In contrast to memory B cells, most 
      plasmablast-derived Abs bound to the structural E protein of dengue, and protection 
      experiments in mice revealed that virus serotypes encountered during past infections 
      were neutralized more efficiently than were the serotypes of the current infection. 
      Together with genetic analyses, we show evidence that plasmablasts in dengue 
      patients are a polyclonal pool of activated E protein-specific memory B cells and 
      that their specificity is not representative of the serum Abs secreted by long-lived 
      plasma cells in the memory phase. These results contribute to the understanding of 
      the phenomenon of original antigenic sin in dengue.

AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome represent the most serious 
      pathophysiological manifestations of human dengue virus infection. Despite intensive 
      research, the mechanisms and important cellular players that contribute to dengue 
      disease are unclear. Mast cells are tissue-resident innate immune cells that play a 
      sentinel cell role in host protection against infectious agents via 
      pathogen-recognition receptors by producing potent mediators that modulate 
      inflammation, cell recruitment and normal vascular homeostasis. Most importantly, 
      mast cells are susceptible to antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection and respond 
      with selective cytokine and chemokine responses. In order to obtain a global view of 
      dengue virus-induced gene regulation in mast cells, primary human cord blood-derived 
      mast cells (CBMCs) and the KU812 and HMC-1 mast cell lines were infected with dengue 
      virus in the presence of dengue-immune sera and their responses were evaluated at 
      the mRNA and protein levels. Mast cells responded to antibody-enhanced dengue virus 
      infection or polyinosiniċpolycytidylic acid treatment with the production of type I 
      interferons and the rapid and potent production of chemokines including CCL4, CCL5 
      and CXCL10. Multiple interferon-stimulated genes were also upregulated as well as 
      mRNA and protein for the RNA sensors PKR, RIG-I and MDA5. Dengue virus-induced 
      chemokine production by KU812 cells was significantly modulated by siRNA knockdown 
      of RIG-I and PKR, in a negative and positive manner, respectively. Pretreatment of 
      fresh KU812 cells with supernatants from dengue virus-infected mast cells provided 
      protection from subsequent infection with dengue virus in a type I 
      interferon-dependent manner. These findings support a role for tissue-resident mast 
      cells in the early detection of antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection via RNA 
      sensors, the protection of neighbouring cells through interferon production and the 
      potential recruitment of leukocytes via chemokine production.

AB  - Robust disease burden estimates are important for decision-making concerning 
      introduction of new vaccines. Dengue is a major public health problem in the tropics 
      but robust disease burden estimates are lacking. We conducted a two-sample, 
      capture-recapture study in the largest province in Cambodia to determine disease 
      under-recognition to the National Dengue Surveillance System (NDSS). During 
      2006-2008, community-based active surveillance for acute febrile illness was 
      conducted in 0- to 19-year-olds in rural and urban areas combined with testing for 
      dengue virus infection. Of 14 354 individuals under active surveillance (22 498 
      person-seasons), the annual incidence ranged from 13·4 to 57·8/1000 person-seasons. 
      During the same period, NDSS incidence rates ranged from 1·1/1000 to 5·7/1000, which 
      was 3·9- to 29·0-fold lower than found in the capture-recapture study. In 
      hospitalized cases, the rate of under-recognition was 1·1- to 2·4-fold. This study 
      shows the substantial degree of under-recognition/reporting of dengue and that 
      reported hospitalized cases are not a good surrogate for estimating dengue disease 
      burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV) is a significant cause of 
      morbidity throughout the world. Although prior research has focused on the 
      association of specific DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) with the 
      development of severe outcomes such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock 
      syndrome, relatively little work has correlated other clinical manifestations with a 
      particular DENV serotype. The goal of this study was to estimate and compare the 
      prevalence of non-hemorrhagic clinical manifestations of DENV infection by serotype. 
      METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Between the years 2005-2010, individuals with 
      febrile disease from Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Paraguay were enrolled in an 
      outpatient passive surveillance study. Detailed information regarding clinical signs 
      and symptoms, as well as demographic information, was collected. DENV infection was 
      confirmed in patient sera with polyclonal antibodies in a culture-based 
      immunofluorescence assay, and the infecting serotype was determined by 
      serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies. Differences in the prevalence of individual 
      and organ-system manifestations were compared across DENV serotypes. One thousand 
      seven hundred and sixteen individuals were identified as being infected with DENV-1 
      (39.8%), DENV-2 (4.3%), DENV-3 (41.5%), or DENV-4 (14.4%). When all four DENV 
      serotypes were compared with each other, individuals infected with DENV-3 had a 
      higher prevalence of musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal manifestations, and 
      individuals infected with DENV-4 had a higher prevalence of respiratory and 
      cutaneous manifestations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Specific clinical 
      manifestations, as well as groups of clinical manifestations, are often 
      overrepresented by an individual DENV serotype.

AB  - Although neurological manifestations associated with dengue infections have been 
      reported in endemic countries, the viral or host characteristics determining the 
      infection or alteration of nervous function have not been described. In order to 
      investigate neurobiological conditions related to central nervous system dengue 
      virus (DENV) infection, we established a mouse model of neuroinfection. A DENV-4 
      isolate was first adapted to neuroblastoma cells, later inoculated in suckling mice 
      brain, and finally, this D4MB-6 viral variant was inoculated intraperitoneally in 
      Balb/c mice at different postnatal days (pnd). Virus-induced fatal encephalitis in 2 
      and 7 pnd mice but infected at 14 and 21 pnd mice survived. The younger mice 
      presented encephalitis at the sixth day postinfection with limb paralysis and 
      postural instability concomitant with efficient viral replication in brain. In this 
      mice model, we found activated microglial cells positive to viral antigen. Neurons, 
      oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells were also infected by the D4MB-6 virus in 
      neonatal mice, which showed generalized and local plasma leakage with blood-brain 
      barrier (BBB) severe damage. These results suggest that there was a viral fitness 
      change which led to neuroinfection only in immune or neurological immature mice. 
      Infection of neurons, endothelial, and microglial cells may be related to 
      detrimental function or architecture found in susceptible mice. This experimental 
      neuroinfection model could help to have a better understanding of neurological 
      manifestations occurring during severe cases of dengue infection.

TI  - Serum proteome changes in dengue virus-infected patients from a dengue-endemic area 
      of India: towards new molecular targets?
PG  - 527-36
LID - 10.1089/omi.2012.0037 [doi]
AB  - The global burden of dengue continues to worsen, specifically in tropical and 
      subtropical countries, and has evolved as a major public health problem. We 
      investigated the changes in serum proteome in dengue fever (DF) patients from a 
      dengue-endemic area of India to obtain mechanistic insights about the disease 
      pathogenesis, the host immune response, and identification of potential serum 
      protein biomarkers of this infectious disease. In this study, serum samples from DF 
      patients, healthy subjects, and patients with falciparum malaria (an infectious 
      disease control) were investigated by 2D-DIGE in combination with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. 
      The findings were validated with Western blotting. Functional clustering of the 
      identified proteins was performed using PANTHER and DAVID tools. Compared to the 
      healthy controls, we found significant changes in the expression levels of 48 
      protein spots corresponding to 18 unique proteins (7 downregulated and 11 
      upregulated) in DF patients (p<0.05). Among these differentially-expressed proteins, 
      11 candidates exhibited different trends in dengue fever compared to falciparum 
      malaria. Importantly, our results suggest that dengue virus infection leads to 
      alterations in expression levels of multiple serum proteins involved in diverse and 
      vital physiological pathways, including acute phase response signaling, complement 
      cascades, hemostasis, and blood coagulation. For the first time we report here that 
      the serum levels of hemopexin, haptoglobin, serum amyloid P, and kininogen 
      precursor, are altered in DF. This study informs the pathogenesis and host immune 
      response to dengue virus infection, as well as the current search for new diagnostic 
      and molecular drug targets.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial of balapiravir, a polymerase 
      inhibitor, in adult dengue patients.
PG  - 1442-50
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jis470 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most common arboviral infection of humans. There are 
      currently no specific treatments for dengue. Balapiravir is a prodrug of a 
      nucleoside analogue (called R1479) and an inhibitor of hepatitis C virus replication 
      in vivo. METHODS: We conducted in vitro experiments to determine the potency of 
      balapiravir against dengue viruses and then an exploratory, dose-escalating, 
      randomized placebo-controlled trial in adult male patients with dengue with <48 
      hours of fever. RESULTS: The clinical and laboratory adverse event profile in 
      patients receiving balapiravir at doses of 1500 mg (n = 10) or 3000 mg (n = 22) 
      orally for 5 days was similar to that of patients receiving placebo (n = 32), 
      indicating balapiravir was well tolerated. However, twice daily assessment of 
      viremia and daily assessment of NS1 antigenemia indicated balapiravir did not 
      measurably alter the kinetics of these virological markers, nor did it reduce the 
      fever clearance time. The kinetics of plasma cytokine concentrations and the whole 
      blood transcriptional profile were also not attenuated by balapiravir treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although this trial, the first of its kind in dengue, does not support 
      balapiravir as a candidate drug, it does establish a framework for antiviral 
      treatment trials in dengue and provides the field with a clinically evaluated 
      benchmark molecule. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01096576.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the unusual breeding sites of two dengue vectors, i.e. Aedes 
      albopictus (Ae. albopictus) and Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti). METHODS: During the 
      second half of 2010, we performed an occasional survey in rural (Teluk Tempoyak) and 
      urban (Gelugor) areas of Penang Island, Malaysia, to identify cryptic breeding 
      sites. RESULTS: In the rural area, we found heterogeneous immature stages of Ae. 
      albopictus in the water bowl of an encaged bird. We also observed Ae. aegypti eggs 
      deposited in the flush tank of a toilet in the urban area. CONCLUSIONS: It can be 
      concluded that both breeding patterns can increase contact with hosts (humans and 
      birds) and presumably population densities of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, 
      thereby potentially boosting the risks for spread and transmission of arboviral 
      diseases.

TI  - Evaluation of the 2009 WHO dengue case classification in an Indonesian pediatric

AB  - The classification of dengue virus-infected patients continues to be a challenge to 
      researchers and clinicians in the field. The accuracy of the 1997 World Health 
      Organization (WHO) dengue case definition has been debated for a decade, because the 
      definition was very stringent, for instance, several researchers showed that 
      apparently severe cases were misclassified as not severe. Therefore the WHO issued 
      revised guidelines in 2009. Here, we retrospectively compared the performance of the 
      WHO case definition of 2009 with the WHO case definition of 1997 in a detailed 
      documented pediatric cohort from Indonesia. Intensive treatment intervention was 
      used as an indicator of severity of disease. In line with our expectations, the 2009 
      WHO case classification proved to be significantly more specific, albeit less 
      sensitive than the WHO case classification of 1997. We conclude that the revised 
      classification is promising both from research and clinical perspectives, but 
      validation of the classification criteria still needs to be addressed.

AB  - Since January 2012, 20 autochthonous cases of dengue virus (DENV) infection have 
      been identified in Réunion. The first cases were detected on the western coast, but 
      the two co-circulating viruses (DENV-1 and DENV-3) seemed to have spread later to 
      different cities of the island. There is a non-negligible risk of increase in viral 
      transmission over the following weeks, so health professionals and public health 
      authorities in Réunion are preparing to face a potential epidemic.

AB  - Dengue infection is endemic in developing countries posing a major public health 
      problem. Clinical manifestations form a broad spectrum and include uncomplicated 
      dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. We report three 
      confirmed cases of dengue infection in pediatric population with central nervous 
      system involvement with certain unreported manifestations resulting in diagnostic 
      dilemma. Increasing evidence of neurotropism by dengue virus emphasizes that 
      clinician be aware of such association and consider dengue infection in cases of 
      febrile encephalitis and myelitis in endemic areas. Early diagnosis and appropriate 
      supportive cars can reverse this potentially fatal disease.

PG  - 675-81
LID - S0037-86822012000600004 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To analyze the liver dysfunction and evolution of signs and symptoms 
      in adult dengue patients during a two-month follow-up period. METHODS: A prospective 
      cohort study was conducted in Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 
      January to July, 2008. The evolution of laboratory and clinical manifestations of 90 
      adult dengue patients was evaluated in five scheduled visits within a two-month 
      follow-up period. Twenty controls were enrolled for the analysis of liver function. 
      Patients with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, those known to be human immunodeficiency 
      virus (HIV) seropositive and pregnant women were excluded from the study. RESULTS: 
      At the end of the second month following diagnosis, we observed that symptoms 
      persisted in 33.3% (30/90) of dengue patients. We also observed that, 57.7% (15/26) 
      of the symptoms persisted at the end of the second month. The most persistent 
      symptoms were arthralgia, fatigue, weakness, adynamia, anorexia, taste alteration, 
      and hair loss. Prior dengue virus (DENV) infection did not predispose patients to a 
      longer duration of symptoms. Among hepatic functions, transaminases had the most 
      remarkable elevation and in some cases remained elevated up to the second month 
      after the disease onset. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels overcame aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST) during the convalescent period. Male patients were more 
      severely affected than females. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue fever may present a wide number 
      of symptoms and elevated liver transaminases at the end of the second month.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever result in 
      significant morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Vector control is often 
      the most effective strategy to prevent disease transmission and novel methods are 
      required to complement existing insecticide-based strategies. Biological control 
      uses natural predators or pathogens to kill mosquitoes or reduce their capacity to 
      transmit disease. Bacteria such as Wolbachia have been proposed to have the 
      potential to provide effective biological control of mosquitoes. AREAS COVERED: A 
      review of the potential role of bacteria in the control of mosquito-borne diseases 
      highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy. In particular, a 
      comprehensive summary of the progress made using the bacterial endosymbiont 
      Wolbachia for dengue control. EXPERT OPINION: Pathogenic bacteria such as Bti can be 
      used to kill mosquito larvae and several endosymbiotic bacteria such as Asaia could 
      be genetically transformed to alter the mosquito's ability to transmit pathogens. 
      The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia has been successfully introduced into the 
      principal vector of dengue, Aedes aegypti, and induces a variety of phenotypic 
      effects that are predicted to reduce dengue transmission. The release of 
      Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes has been undertaken as part of preliminary trials to 
      determine the applied use of this bacterium for mosquito-borne disease control.

TI  - Circulation of Dengue virus-1 (DENV-1) serotype in Delhi, during 2010-11 after 
      Dengue virus-3 (DENV-3) predominance: a single centre hospital-based study.
PG  - 82-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delhi, a city in north India, has so far witnessed several reported 
      outbreaks of dengue. Dengue in Delhi from being epidemic is slowly changing towards 
      being endemic and hyper-endemic. Circulating type of the virus is also changing over 
      the years. In the absence of an effective vaccine, dengue prevention to a major 
      extent relies on virological surveillance, and development of effective, locally 
      adapted control programmes. In the present study, we tried to identify the 
      between-year non-epidemic serotype of dengue virus circulating in Delhi, during 
      2010-11. METHODS: Acute-phase samples were collected from the patients attending the 
      Institute of Liver & Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India. Dengue diagnosis was done 
      using WHO case definitions. All the samples were subjected to Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA 
      and modified nested RT-PCR. RESULTS: A total of 75 acute-phase samples were 
      received, of which 19 (25.3%) were positive for dengue NS1 antigen. Dengue RT-PCR 
      was positive in 14.6% (11/75) samples. All the RT-PCR isolates were of DENV-1 
      serotype. No case of concomitant infection with more than one serotype was observed. 
      Median age of involvement was 23 yr (range10-86). Maximum number of cases were seen 
      in the age group of 21-30 yr. Male to female ratio was 1.2 : 1. Maximum number of 
      suspected dengue cases (n=79) was seen during September and October. CONCLUSIONS: 
      DENV-1 was circulating in Delhi in the year 2010-11 in non-epidemic period following 
      reported predominance of DENV-3 and co-circulation of all dengue serotypes in the 
      epidemic years 2003, 2006 and 2007.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the distribution of reproductive outcomes 
      following dengue virus infection during pregnancy (2001-2005). An ecological 
      epidemiological study was conducted in all counties with more than 80,000 
      inhabitants in Southeast Brazil. The study explored the correlation between dengue 
      incidence rates in women 15-39 years of age and selected mortality indicators 
      (maternal, fetal, perinatal, neonatal, early neonatal, and infant) in these 
      counties, and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated. A positive 
      correlation was observed between median dengue incidence in women 15-39 years of age 
      and median maternal mortality (r = 0.88; 95%CI: 0.51; 1.00), with a determination 
      coefficient R² = 0.78. The correlation between dengue incidence in childbearing-age 
      women and reproductive outcomes in Southeast Brazil suggests that dengue infection 
      during pregnancy can negatively impact its outcome and increase maternal mortality.

TI  - The burden of dengue infection in some vulnerable regions of Nepal.
PG  - 114-7
AB  - Dengue is an emerging mosquito borne disease of public health importance in Nepal. A 
      descriptive cross sectional study was carried out to estimate sero-prevalence and 
      distribution pattern of dengue in certain vulnerable regions of Nepal from June to 
      September 2009. A total of 460 venous blood samples were collected from individuals 
      experiencing a febrile illness clinically consistent with dengue infection visiting 
      nearby hospitals of Kanchanpur, Kailali, Banke, Dang and Chitwan districts. The 
      sero-prevalence of dengue virus specific IgM was determined by enzyme linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The anti-dengue IgM positivity was found to be 
      12.17%. The higher frequency of positive cases (16.4%) were from age group 20-40 
      years followed by < 20 years age group with 9.7% and 5.3% from > 40 years age group. 
      The association between dengue infection and age is found to be statistically 
      significant (p < 0.05). The male:female ratio was determined as 1.3:1 in IgM 
      positive population. Among sampling areas, Kanchanpur showed highest prevalence of 
      dengue infection (15.5%) followed by Chitwan (11.7%), Kailai (11.1%), Banke (10.7%) 
      and Dang (8.3%). Similarly, 94.6% of the positive cases were indigeneous and had no 
      history of travel to other countries. Dengue is firmly established in terai region 
      with increasing trends of infection and expansion into newer areas raising a public 
      health threat. Regular epidemiological studies are suggested which could further 
      reveal the contributing factors associated with dengue virus infection and help in 
      formulating strategies in reducing the transmission rate and control of the 
      infection.

AB  - Interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins restrict the entry processes of 
      several pathogenic viruses, including the flaviviruses West Nile virus and dengue 
      virus (DENV). DENV infects cells directly or via antibody-dependent enhancement 
      (ADE) in Fc-receptor-bearing cells, a process thought to contribute to severe 
      disease in a secondary infection. Here we investigated whether ADE-mediated DENV 
      infection bypasses IFITM-mediated restriction or whether IFITM proteins can be 
      protective in a secondary infection. We observed that IFITM proteins restricted 
      ADE-mediated and direct infection with comparable efficiencies in a myelogenous 
      leukemia cell line. Our data suggest that IFITM proteins can contribute to control 
      of secondary DENV infections.

TI  - Dengue in travellers: applicability of the 1975-1997 and the 2009 WHO classification 
      system of dengue fever.
PG  - 1023-30
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.03020.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the applicability and benefits of 
      the new WHO dengue fever guidelines in clinical practice, for returning travellers. 
      METHODS: We compared differences in specificity and sensitivity between the old and 
      the new guidelines for diagnosing dengue and assessed the usefulness in predicting 
      the clinical course of the disease. Also, we investigated whether hypertension, 
      diabetes or allergies, ethnicity or high age influenced the course of disease. 
      RESULTS: In our setting, the old classification, compared with the new, had a 
      marginally higher sensitivity for diagnosing dengue. The new classification had a 
      slightly higher specificity and was less rigid. Patients with dengue who had warning 
      signs as postulated in the new classification were admitted more often than those 
      who had no warning signs (RR, 8.09 [1.80-35.48]). We did not find ethnicity, age, 
      hypertension, diabetes mellitus or allergies to be predictive of the clinical 
      course. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of returned travellers, the new classification 
      system did not differ in sensitivity and specificity from the old system to a 
      clinically relevant degree. The guidelines did not improve identification of severe 
      disease.

AB  - The efficacy of insecticide-treated window curtains (ITCs) for dengue vector control 
      was evaluated in Thailand in a cluster-randomized controlled trial. A total of 2,037 
      houses in 26 clusters was randomized to receive the intervention or act as control 
      (no treatment). Entomological surveys measured Aedes infestations (Breteau index, 
      house index, container index, and pupae per person index) and oviposition indices 
      (mean numbers of eggs laid in oviposition traps) immediately before and after 
      intervention, and at 3-month intervals over 12 months. There were no consistent 
      statistically significant differences in entomological indices between intervention 
      and control clusters, although oviposition indices were lower (P < 0.01) in ITC 
      clusters during the wet season. It is possible that the open housing structures in 
      the study reduced the likelihood of mosquitoes making contact with ITCs. ITCs 
      deployed in a region where this house design is common may be unsuitable for dengue 
      vector control.

TI  - Climate change, population immunity, and hyperendemicity in the transmission 
      threshold of dengue.
PG  - e48258
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0048258 [doi]
LID - e48258
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the probability of dengue epidemics could 
      increase because of climate change. The probability of epidemics is most commonly 
      evaluated by the basic reproductive number (R(0)), and in mosquito-borne diseases, 
      mosquito density (the number of female mosquitoes per person [MPP]) is the critical 
      determinant of the R(0) value. In dengue-endemic areas, 4 different serotypes of 
      dengue virus coexist-a state known as hyperendemicity-and a certain proportion of 
      the population is immune to one or more of these serotypes. Nevertheless, these 
      factors are not included in the calculation of R(0). We aimed to investigate the 
      effects of temperature change, population immunity, and hyperendemicity on the 
      threshold MPP that triggers an epidemic. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We designed a 
      mathematical model of dengue transmission dynamics. An epidemic was defined as a 10% 
      increase in seroprevalence in a year, and the MPP that triggered an epidemic was 
      defined as the threshold MPP. Simulations were conducted in Singapore based on the 
      recorded temperatures from 1980 to 2009 The threshold MPP was estimated with the 
      effect of (1) temperature only; (2) temperature and fluctuation of population 
      immunity; and (3) temperature, fluctuation of immunity, and hyperendemicity. When 
      only the effect of temperature was considered, the threshold MPP was estimated to be 
      0.53 in the 1980s and 0.46 in the 2000s, a decrease of 13.2%. When the fluctuation 
      of population immunity and hyperendemicity were considered in the model, the 
      threshold MPP decreased by 38.7%, from 0.93 to 0.57, from the 1980s to the 2000s. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The threshold MPP was underestimated if population immunity was not 
      considered and overestimated if hyperendemicity was not included in the simulations. 
      In addition to temperature, these factors are particularly important when 
      quantifying the threshold MPP for the purpose of setting goals for vector control in 
      dengue-endemic areas.

AB  - Consecutive febrile admissions were enrolled at two hospitals in Moshi, Tanzania. 
      Confirmed acute Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), and flavivirus 
      infection were defined as a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. 
      Presumptive acute DENV infection was defined as a positive anti-DENV immunoglobulin 
      M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay (ELISA) result, and prior flavivirus 
      exposure was defined as a positive anti-DENV IgG ELISA result. Among 870 
      participants, PCR testing was performed on 700 (80.5%). Of these, 55 (7.9%) had 
      confirmed acute CHIKV infection, whereas no participants had confirmed acute DENV or 
      flavivirus infection. Anti-DENV IgM serologic testing was performed for 747 (85.9%) 
      participants, and of these 71 (9.5%) had presumptive acute DENV infection. Anti-DENV 
      IgG serologic testing was performed for 751 (86.3%) participants, and of these 80 
      (10.7%) had prior flavivirus exposure. CHIKV infection was more common among infants 
      and children than adults and adolescents (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, P = 0.026) and among 
      HIV-infected patients with severe immunosuppression (OR 10.5, P = 0.007). CHIKV 
      infection is an important but unrecognized cause of febrile illness in northern 
      Tanzania. DENV or other closely related flaviviruses are likely also circulating.

TI  - Dengue mortality in patients under 18 years old: an analysis from the health 
      situation analysis of Thai population in 2010 project.
PG  - S108-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical and 
      subtropical regions of the world. In Thailand, there has been no detailed research 
      on mortality in children in terms of duration of admission and associated 
      complications in the cases that died. OBJECTIVE: To assess the burden of dengue in 
      Thailand in 2010 and to analyze the complications in patients aged under 18 years 
      who died. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors described the mortality and complications 
      of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever in patients under 18 years old using 
      the information from the Health Situation Analysis of the Thai Population 2010 
      Project. RESULTS: In 2010, the overall mortality of dengue in all age groups and in 
      patients aged under 18 years were 0.3 and 0.6/ 100,000, respectively. The mortality 
      rate was highest among children aged 6-12 years (0.8/100,000). Among the 8 children 
      with dengue fever that died, the 2 most common complications were fluid electrolyte 
      and acid-base imbalance and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The common 
      complications among the 91 cases with dengue hemorrhagic fever that died included 
      fluid electrolyte and acid-base imbalance, hepatic failure, respiratory failure, 
      bacterial infection, DIC and renal failure. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis, careful 
      management of fluid therapy, awareness of hepatic and renal impairment and early 
      treatment of co-infection should decrease mortality of dengue hemorrhagic fever

TI  - Simple, specific molecular typing of dengue virus isolates using one-step RT-PCR and

AB  - A one-step RT-PCR and one-enzyme RFLP was used to detect and distinguish among 
      flaviviruses, including the four serotypes of dengue and the St. Louis Encephalitis, 
      West Nile and Yellow Fever viruses in cultured virus samples or acute-phase human 
      serum. Using a previously described RT-PCR, but novel RFLP procedure, results are 
      obtained in 24 h with basic PCR and electrophoresis equipment. There is 95% 
      agreement between RT-PCR/RFLP results and those achieved by indirect 
      immunofluorescence assays, and 100% agreement between RT-PCR/RFLP results and gene 
      sequencing. This method is more rapid than tests of cytopathic effect based on virus 
      isolation in tissue culture, and simpler than real-time PCR. It does not require 
      specialized equipment, radioisotopes or computer analysis and is a method that can 
      be applied widely in the developing world. It allows for prompt determination of 
      whether a flavivirus is the cause of illness in a febrile patient, rapid 
      identification of dengue serotypes in circulation, and improved patient management 
      in cases where prior dengue exposure make dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock 
      syndrome a risk.

TI  - Synchrony of sylvatic dengue isolations: a multi-host, multi-vector SIR model of 
      dengue virus transmission in Senegal.
PG  - e1928
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001928 [doi]
LID - e1928
AB  - Isolations of sylvatic dengue-2 virus from mosquitoes, humans and non-human primates 
      in Senegal show synchronized multi-annual dynamics over the past 50 years. Host 
      demography has been shown to directly affect the period between epidemics in other 
      pathogen systems, therefore, one might expect unsynchronized multi-annual cycles 
      occurring in hosts with dramatically different birth rates and life spans. However, 
      in Senegal, we observe a single synchronized eight-year cycle across all vector 
      species, suggesting synchronized dynamics in all vertebrate hosts. In the current 
      study, we aim to explore two specific hypotheses: 1) primates with different 
      demographics will experience outbreaks of dengue at different periodicities when 
      observed as isolated systems, and that coupling of these subsystems through mosquito 
      biting will act to synchronize incidence; and 2) the eight-year periodicity of 
      isolations observed across multiple primate species is the result of long-term 
      cycling in population immunity in the host populations. To test these hypotheses, we 
      develop a multi-host, multi-vector Susceptible, Infected, Removed (SIR) model to 
      explore the effects of coupling multiple host-vector systems of dengue virus 
      transmission through cross-species biting rates. We find that under small amounts of 
      coupling, incidence in the host species synchronize. Long-period multi-annual 
      dynamics are observed only when prevalence in troughs reaches vanishingly small 
      levels (< 10(-10)), suggesting that these dynamics are inconsistent with sustained 
      transmission in this setting, but are consistent with local dengue virus extinctions 
      followed by reintroductions. Inclusion of a constant introduction of infectious 
      individuals into the system causes the multi-annual periods to shrink, while the 
      effects of coupling remain the same. Inclusion of a stochastic rate of introduction 
      allows for multi-annual periods at a cost of reduced synchrony. Thus, we conclude 
      that the eight-year period separating amplifications of dengue may be explained by 
      cycling in immunity with stochastic introductions.

TI  - Prognostic value of rapid test for diagnosis of dengue in Nepalese patients during 
      2010 epidemic.
PG  - 7-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is an emerging vector borne disease in Nepal and rapid diagnostic 
      test is important for early diagnosis of the disease. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the 
      study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of commonly used rapid 
      immunochromatographic test kit in Nepal during 2010 dengue epidemic and to assess 
      disease burden of dengue. METHODS: A total of 131 acute and nonacute serum samples 
      were collected during recent epidemic of dengue in 2010 from clinically suspected 
      Nepalese patients of different hospitals. Rapid immunochromatographic test kit was 
      used for early diagnosis and enzyme immunosorbent was chosen as a reference assay. 
      RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of rapid test was 70% and 76.54% 
      respectively whereas the prevalence of the disease was 38.17%. The odds ratio for 
      males was 1.8 however; the association with the disease was statistically not 
      significant. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic accuracy of rapid immunochromatographic test 
      for dengue diagnosis was low (k=0.46). So, it should be substituted by highly 
      sensitive test device for prompt diagnosis and health personnel should consider 
      appropriate timing of sample collection for better performance of rapid test.

AB  - To understand its unprecedented resurgence, we examined the epidemiological, 
      virological, and entomological features of dengue in Guangzhou during 1978-2009. 
      Cases reported to the Guangzhou Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and data 
      from virological and entomological surveillance were analyzed from three periods: 
      1978-1988, 1989-1999, and 2000-2009. Although cases decreased over time: 6,649 
      (1978-1988) to 6,479 (1989-1999) to 2,526 (2000-2009), geographical expansion 
      resulted in districts with an average incidence >2.5/100,000, increasing from five 
      (1978-1988, 1989-1999) to seven (2000-2009). Age distribution (mean age: 34.9 years) 
      provided a trend of increasing dengue incidence among adults, and there was a 
      significantly higher incidence among men with a sex ratio of 1.15:1 (P<0.001). Cases 
      occurred from May through November with a peak between August and October, and a 
      long-term trend was characterized by a three to five-year cyclical pattern. The most 
      frequently isolated serotypes were DENV-2 (1978-1988) and DENV-1 (1989-1999 and 
      2000-2009). Seasonal fluctuations in immature densities of Aedes albopictus (sole 
      transmission vector in Guangzhou) were consistent with the dengue seasonality. After 
      a 30-year apparent absence, DENV-3 had reemerged in 2009. The current 
      epidemiological situation is highly conducive to periodic dengue resurgences. Thus, 
      a high degree of surveillance and strict control measures in source reduction should 
      be maintained.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To model the monthly number of dengue fever cases in northeastern 
      Thailand using time series analysis. METHODS: Autoregressive Integrated Moving 
      Average (ARIMA) models have been developed on the monthly data collected from 
      January 1981 to December 2006 and validated using the data from January 2007 to 
      April 2010. RESULTS: The ARIMA (3,1,4) model has been found as the most suitable 
      model with the least Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of 14.060 and Mean Absolute 
      Percent Error (MAPE) of 7.000. The model was further validated by the Portmanteau 
      test with no significant autocorrelation between residuals at different lag times. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Early warning based on the data in the previous months could assist in 
      improving vector control, community intervention, and personal protection.

LID - 10.1093/infdis/jis744 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Protection against dengue requires immunity against all 4 serotypes of 
      dengue virus (DENV). Experimental challenge may be useful in evaluating 
      vaccine-induced immunity. METHODS: Ten subjects previously vaccinated with a live 
      attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (TDV) and 4 DENV-naive control subjects were 
      challenged by subcutaneous inoculation of either 10(3) plaque-forming units (PFU) of 
      DENV-1 or 10(5) PFU of DENV-3. Two additional subjects who did not develop DENV-3 
      neutralizing antibody (NAb) from TDV were revaccinated with 10(4) PFU of live 
      attenuated DENV-3 vaccine to evaluate memory response. RESULTS: All 5 TDV recipients 
      were protected against DENV-1 challenge. Of the 5 TDV recipients challenged with 
      DENV-3, 2 were protected. All DENV-3-challenge subjects who developed viremia also 
      developed elevated liver enzyme levels, and 2 had values that were >10 times greater 
      than normal. Of the 2 subjects revaccinated with DENV-3 vaccine, 1 showed a 
      secondary response to DENV-2, while neither showed such response to DENV-3. All 4 
      control subjects developed dengue fever from challenge. Protection was associated 
      with presence of NAb, although 1 subject was protected despite a lack of measurable 
      NAb at the time of DENV-1 challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with TDV induced 
      variable protection against subcutaneous challenge. DENV-3 experimental challenge 
      was associated with transient but marked elevations of transaminases.

AB  - Vitamin D is known to affect pathogenesis of dengue through modulation of immune 
      responses. Vitamin D exerts its effects through vitamin D receptor (VDR). The 
      functioning of VDR is affected by the gene polymorphisms in the coding (rs2228570) 
      and 3'untranslated region (UTR) (rs1544410, rs7975232 and rs731236). In the present 
      study, VDR gene polymorphisms were investigated in 112 dengue infected patients (83 
      dengue fever (DF) and 29 dengue hemorrhagic fever cases (DHF)) and 105 apparently 
      healthy controls (HCs) using polymerase chain reaction based restriction fragment 
      length polymorphisms methods. HCs had no documented evidence of symptomatic dengue. 
      Results revealed significantly lower frequency of 'C' allele of rs7975232 in all 
      dengue patients (DEN) as compared to HCs [(P corrected (Pc)=0.014, Odds ratio (OR) 
      0.51]. The frequency of C/C genotype of rs7975232 was significantly lower in DEN and 
      DF cases compared to HCs (DEN vs. HCs: Pc=0.0184, OR 0.24; DF cases vs. HCs: 
      Pc=0.028, OR 0.21). The frequency of T allele of rs2228570 in a dominant mode was 
      significantly higher in DHF cases as compared to DF cases (P=0.034 OR 2.58). A 
      significantly lower frequency of the haplotype G-C-T (Pc=0.0135) and higher 
      frequency of the haplotype G-A-T (Pc=0.000085) was observed in DEN and DF cases as 
      compared to HCs. The results suggest that the 3'UTR haplotypes of VDR gene are 
      differentially associated with risk of symptomatic dengue requiring hospitalization. 
      The 'T' allele of rs2228570 polymorphism in a dominant mode of inheritance is 
      associated with DHF.

PG  - 161-72
LID - 10.1007/s10875-011-9592-9 [doi]
AB  - Laboratory predictors of severe forms of dengue virus (DENV) infection are needed. 
      These clinical forms seem to be associated with high viremia, stressing the 
      importance of immune responses, which could involve dendritic cells (DC). Yet, very 
      few studies have evaluated DC after DENV infection. We assessed peripheral blood DC 
      subset numbers in mild and severe forms of dengue in 44 patients, older than 15 
      years old, infected with serotypes DENV-2, 3 or 4. Patients were divided in high, 
      intermediate and no detectable viremia according to results of molecular biology 
      amplification of DENV. Serological status of anti-DENV IgG or IgM determined primary 
      or secondary infections. Plasmacytoid and myeloid DC absolute and relative numbers 
      were reduced in infected patients when compared to an age-matched healthy control 
      group, but no significant differences in DC numbers were observed between mild or 
      severe forms of disease. A severe disease was more frequent in patients infected 
      with DENV-2 serotype and with secondary infection but no significant differences in 
      DC subset numbers were found related to these variables. Viremia levels did not 
      correlate to disease severity yet were associated to lower DC numbers. Plasmacytoid 
      DC numbers were significantly lower in high and intermediate viremia groups compared 
      to non-infected controls, but not in no detectable viremia patients. Myeloid DC 
      numbers were also significantly lower than controls, even in no detectable viremia 
      patients. These results confirm that circulating DC subset numbers are reduced after 
      DENV infection, although this is not a biomarker of severe forms of dengue in 
      adults.

      infection in humans.
PG  - 2911-8
LID - 10.1128/JVI.06075-11 [doi]
AB  - Humoral immune responses are thought to play a major role in dengue virus-induced 
      immunopathology; however, little is known about the plasmablasts producing these 
      antibodies during an ongoing infection. Herein we present an analysis of plasmablast 
      responses in patients with acute dengue virus infection. We found very potent 
      plasmablast responses that often increased more than 1,000-fold over the baseline 
      levels in healthy volunteers. In many patients, these responses made up as much 30% 
      of the peripheral lymphocyte population. These responses were largely dengue virus 
      specific and almost entirely made up of IgG-secreting cells, and plasmablasts 
      reached very high numbers at a time after fever onset that generally coincided with 
      the window where the most serious dengue virus-induced pathology is observed. The 
      presence of these large, rapid, and virus-specific plasmablast responses raises the 
      question as to whether these cells might have a role in dengue immunopathology 
      during the ongoing infection. These findings clearly illustrate the need for a 
      detailed understanding of the repertoire and specificity of the antibodies that 
      these plasmablasts produce.

PG  - 281-5
LID - 10.4103/0019-557X.106415 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To develop a prediction model for dengue fever/dengue haemorrhagic fever 
      (DF/DHF) using time series data over the past decade in Rajasthan and to forecast 
      monthly DF/DHF incidence for 2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seasonal autoregressive 
      integrated moving average (SARIMA) model was used for statistical modeling. RESULTS: 
      During January 2001 to December 2010, the reported DF/DHF cases showed a cyclical 
      pattern with seasonal variation. SARIMA (0,0,1) (0,1,1) 12 model had the lowest 
      normalized Bayesian information criteria (BIC) of 9.426 and mean absolute percentage 
      error (MAPE) of 263.361 and appeared to be the best model. The proportion of 
      variance explained by the model was 54.3%. Adequacy of the model was established 
      through Ljung-Box test (Q statistic 4.910 and P-value 0.996), which showed no 
      significant correlation between residuals at different lag times. The forecast for 
      the year 2011 showed a seasonal peak in the month of October with an estimated 546 
      cases. CONCLUSION: Application of SARIMA model may be useful for forecast of cases 
      and impending outbreaks of DF/DHF and other infectious diseases, which exhibit 
      seasonal pattern.

TI  - Early predictors of clinically significant bleeding in adults with dengue infection.
PG  - 890-9
AB  - Hemorrhage is an important complication in dengue infection, but early predictors of 
      clinically significant bleeding are undefined. This study aimed to determine 
      clinical factors on admission associated with Type I bleeding, defined as 
      gastrointestinal bleed, hematuria and menorrhagia, among adult patients with dengue 
      infection. We carried out a retrospective study among 277 patients aged >15 years 
      with serologically-confirmed dengue infection admitted to the Hospital for Tropical 
      Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand during 2006-2009. Female gender (p<0.001), vomiting 
      (p=0.05), severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 25 x 10(9)/l; p=0.007), high 
      absolute lymphocyte count (ALC >500; p=0.05) and high aspartate aminotransferase 
      level (AST >200; p=0.02) were significantly associated with hemorrhage on univariate 
      analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed variables associated with bleeding were 
      female gender [odds ratio (OR) 14.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.56, 
      p<0.001], thrombocytopenia (OR 4.7; 95%CI 0.13-0.9, p=0.03) and ALC >500 (OR 5.7; 
      95%CI 1.17-4.99, p=0.02). These data identify patients at high risk for developing 
      clinically significant bleeding with dengue infection.

TI  - Effects of short-course oral corticosteroid therapy in early dengue infection in 
      Vietnamese patients: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1216-24
LID - 10.1093/cid/cis655 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with dengue can experience a variety of serious complications 
      including hypovolemic shock, thrombocytopenia, and bleeding. These problems occur as 
      plasma viremia is resolving and are thought to be immunologically mediated. Early 
      corticosteroid therapy may prevent the development of such complications but could 
      also prolong viral clearance. METHODS: We performed a randomized, 
      placebo-controlled, blinded trial of low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) or high-dose (2 mg/kg) 
      oral prednisolone therapy for 3 days in Vietnamese patients aged 5-20 years admitted 
      with dengue and fever for ≤72 hours, aiming to assess potential harms from steroid 
      use during the viremic phase. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using linear 
      trend tests with a range of clinical and virological endpoints specified in advance. 
      In addition to recognized complications of dengue, we focused on the are under the 
      curve for serial plasma viremia measurements and the number of days after enrollment 
      to negative viremia and dengue nonstructural protein 1 status. RESULTS: Between 
      August 2009 and January 2011, 225 participants were randomized to 1 of the 3 
      treatment arms. Baseline characteristics were similar across the groups. All 
      patients recovered fully and adverse events were infrequent. Aside from a trend 
      toward hyperglycemia in the steroid recipients, we found no association between 
      treatment allocation and any of the predefined clinical, hematological, or 
      virological endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral prednisolone during the early acute 
      phase of dengue infection was not associated with prolongation of viremia or other 
      adverse effects. Although not powered to assess efficacy, we found no reduction in 
      the development of shock or other recognized complications of dengue virus infection 
      in this study.

TI  - Immunogenicity and safety of recombinant tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) in 
      individuals aged 2-45 y: Phase II randomized controlled trial in Singapore.
PG  - 1259-71
LID - 10.4161/hv.21224 [doi]
AB  - This was a multicenter, blinded, Phase II study (NCT00880893) conducted in 
      Singapore. The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety of a tetravalent 
      dengue vaccine (TDV) comprising four recombinant, live, attenuated viruses (CYD-TDV) 
      and the dengue virus serotype-specific antibody responses before and 28 d after each 
      vaccination. Participants were randomized 3:1 to receive three doses of CYD-TDV or a 
      control vaccine at 0, 6 and 12 mo. Control vaccine was placebo for the first dose 
      (all ages) and for subsequent doses, licensed hepatitis-A for children (aged 2-11 y) 
      or influenza vaccine for adolescents (12-17 y) and adults (18-45 y). Between April 
      and October 2009, 317 children, 187 adolescents and 696 adults were enrolled. In all 
      age groups, reactogenicity was higher after the first injection of CYD-TDV than 
      after placebo control. Reactogenicity after subsequent CYD-TDV doses was no higher 
      than after the first dose, and tended to be lower or similar to that seen after 
      active control vaccination. Seropositivity rates and geometric mean neutralizing 
      antibody titers (GMTs; 1/dil) against all four dengue virus serotypes increased in 
      all age groups after each of the three CYD-TDV doses. Post-dose 3, 66.5% of all 
      participants were seropositive to all four serotypes, and 87.2% were seropositive to 
      ≥ 3 serotypes; GMTs for all participants ranged from 43.0 against dengue virus 
      serotype 1 to 100 against dengue virus serotype 4. GMTs were higher in children than 
      in adolescents. These results support the continued development of CYD-TDV for the 
      prevention of dengue disease.

TI  - The development of an early warning system for climate-sensitive disease risk with a 
      focus on dengue epidemics in Southeast Brazil.
PG  - 864-83
LID - 10.1002/sim.5549 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies demonstrate statistically significant associations between disease 
      and climate variations, highlighting the potential for developing climate-based 
      epidemic early warning systems. However, limitations include failure to allow for 
      non-climatic confounding factors, limited geographical/temporal resolution, or lack 
      of evaluation of predictive validity. Here, we consider such issues for dengue in 
      Southeast Brazil using a spatio-temporal generalised linear mixed model with 
      parameters estimated in a Bayesian framework, allowing posterior predictive 
      distributions to be derived in time and space. This paper builds upon a preliminary 
      study by Lowe et al. but uses extended, more recent data and a refined model 
      formulation, which, amongst other adjustments, incorporates past dengue risk to 
      improve model predictions. For the first time, a thorough evaluation and validation 
      of model performance is conducted using out-of-sample predictions and demonstrates 
      considerable improvement over a model that mirrors current surveillance practice. 
      Using the model, we can issue probabilistic dengue early warnings for pre-defined 
      'alert' thresholds. With the use of the criterion 'greater than a 50% chance of 
      exceeding 300 cases per 100,000 inhabitants', there would have been successful 
      epidemic alerts issued for 81% of the 54 regions that experienced epidemic dengue 
      incidence rates in February-April 2008, with a corresponding false alarm rate of 
      25%. We propose a novel visualisation technique to map ternary probabilistic 
      forecasts of dengue risk. This technique allows decision makers to identify areas 
      where the model predicts with certainty a particular dengue risk category, to 
      effectively target limited resources to those districts most at risk for a given 
      season.

      severity in dengue patients.
PG  - 80-7
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1103350 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a globally expanding disease caused by infection with dengue virus (DENV) 
      that ranges from febrile illness to acute disease with serious complications. 
      Secondary infection predisposes individuals to more severe disease, and B 
      lymphocytes may play a role in this phenomenon through production of Ab that enhance 
      infection. To better define the acute B cell response during dengue, we analyzed 
      peripheral B cells from an adult Brazilian hospital cohort with primary and 
      secondary DENV infections of varying clinical severity. Circulating B cells in 
      dengue patients were proliferating, activated, and apoptotic relative to individuals 
      with other febrile illnesses. Severe secondary DENV infection was associated with 
      extraordinary peak plasmablast frequencies between 4 and 7 d of illness, averaging 
      46% and reaching 87% of B cells, significantly greater than those seen in mild 
      illness or primary infections. On average >70% of IgG-secreting cells in individuals 
      with severe secondary DENV infection were DENV specific. Plasmablasts produced Ab 
      that cross-reacted with heterotypic DENV serotypes, but with a 3-fold greater 
      reactivity to DENV-3, the infecting serotype. Plasmablast frequency did not 
      correlate with acute serum-neutralizing Ab titers to any DENV serotype regardless of 
      severity of disease. These findings indicate that massive expansion of DENV-specific 
      and serotype cross-reactive plasmablasts occurs in acute secondary DENV infection of 
      adults in Brazil, which is associated with increasing disease severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Roughly half the world's population live in dengue-endemic countries, 
      but no vaccine is licensed. We investigated the efficacy of a recombinant, live, 
      attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine. METHODS: In this observer-masked, randomised, 
      controlled, monocentre, phase 2b, proof-of-concept trial, healthy Thai 
      schoolchildren aged 4-11 years were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive three 
      injections of dengue vaccine or control (rabies vaccine or placebo) at months 0, 6, 
      and 12. Randomisation was by computer-generated permuted blocks of six and 
      participants were assigned with an interactive response system. Participants were 
      actively followed up until month 25. All acute febrile illnesses were investigated. 
      Dengue viraemia was confirmed by serotype-specific RT-PCR and non-structural protein 
      1 ELISA. The primary objective was to assess protective efficacy against 
      virologically confirmed, symptomatic dengue, irrespective of severity or serotype, 
      occurring 1 month or longer after the third injection (per-protocol analysis). This 
      trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00842530. FINDINGS: 4002 participants 
      were assigned to vaccine (n=2669) or control (n=1333). 3673 were included in the 
      primary analysis (2452 vaccine, 1221 control). 134 cases of virologically confirmed 
      dengue occurred during the study. Efficacy was 30·2% (95% CI -13·4 to 56·6), and 
      differed by serotype. Dengue vaccine was well tolerated, with no safety signals 
      after 2 years of follow-up after the first dose. INTERPRETATION: These data show for 
      the first time that a safe vaccine against dengue is possible. Ongoing large-scale 
      phase 3 studies in various epidemiological settings will provide pivotal data for 
      the CYD dengue vaccine candidate. FUNDING: Sanofi Pasteur.

AB  - Dengue, a reemerging disease, is one of the most important viral diseases 
      transmitted by mosquitoes. Climate is considered an important factor in the temporal 
      and spatial distribution of vector-transmitted diseases. This study examined the 
      effect of seasonal factors and the relationship between climatic variables and 
      dengue risk in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 2001 to 2009. Generalized 
      linear models were used, with Poisson and negative binomial distributions. The best 
      fitted model was the one with "minimum temperature" and "precipitation", both lagged 
      by one month, controlled for "year". In that model, a 1°C increase in a month's 
      minimum temperature led to a 45% increase in dengue cases in the following month, 
      while a 10-millimeter rise in precipitation led to a 6% increase in dengue cases in 
      the following month. Dengue transmission involves many factors: although still not 
      fully understood, climate is a critical factor, since it facilitates analysis of the 
      risk of epidemics.

TI  - Application of eco-friendly tools and eco-bio-social strategies to control dengue 
      vectors in urban and peri-urban settings in Thailand.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is considered one of the most important vector-borne diseases in 
      Thailand. Its incidence is increasing despite routine implementation of national 
      dengue control programmes. This study, conducted during 2010, aimed to demonstrate 
      an application of integrated, community-based, eco-bio-social strategies in 
      combination with locally-produced eco-friendly vector control tools in the dengue 
      control programme, emphasizing urban and peri-urban settings in eastern Thailand. 
      METHODOLOGY: Three different community settings were selected and were randomly 
      assigned to intervention and control clusters. Key community leaders and relevant 
      governmental authorities were approached to participate in this intervention 
      programme. Ecohealth volunteers were identified and trained in each study community. 
      They were selected among active community health volunteers and were trained by 
      public health experts to conduct vector control activities in their own communities 
      using environmental management in combination with eco-friendly vector control 
      tools. These trained ecohealth volunteers carried out outreach health education and 
      vector control during household visits. Management of public spaces and public 
      properties, especially solid waste management, was efficiently carried out by local 
      municipalities. Significant reduction in the pupae per person index in the 
      intervention clusters when compared to the control ones was used as a proxy to 
      determine the impact of this programme. RESULTS: Our community-based dengue vector 
      control programme demonstrated a significant reduction in the pupae per person index 
      during entomological surveys which were conducted at two-month intervals from May 
      2010 for the total of six months in the intervention and control clusters. The 
      programme also raised awareness in applying eco-friendly vector control approaches 
      and increased intersectoral and household participation in dengue control 
      activities. CONCLUSION: An eco-friendly dengue vector control programme was 
      successfully implemented in urban and peri-urban settings in Thailand, through 
      intersectoral collaboration and practical action at household level, with a 
      significant reduction in vector densities.

AB  - The intra-alveolar hemorrhage syndrome is defined by the presence of red cells in 
      the alveolar lumen and can lead to acute respiratory failure. Among the infectious 
      etiologies of this syndrome, leptospirosis is a common cause, whereas in dengue, the 
      intra-alveolar hemorrhage is exceptional. We report a patient aged 46 years, with no 
      particular history, who presented a clinical picture involving acute respiratory 
      failure, hemoptysis, bilateral alveolar images and anemia. The intra-alveolar 
      hemorrhage has been authenticated by bronchoalveolar lavage. The etiological showed 
      infection by both dengue and leptospirosis.

TI  - Reemergence and decline of dengue virus serotype 3 in Puerto Rico.
PG  - 893-901
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jis426 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) Indian subcontinent strain emerged 
      in Puerto Rico in 1998 after a 21-year absence. The rapid expansion of DENV-3 on the 
      island correlated with the withdrawal of the other serotypes for 7 years. The DENV-3 
      prevalence declined in 2008 and remains undetected. METHODS: We sequenced complete 
      genomes of 92 DENV-3 clinical isolates to characterize the molecular evolution and 
      phylogeography throughout 10 years of continued sampling (1998–2007). RESULTS: We 
      documented 8 distinct lineages that emerged simultaneously and evolved 
      independently. Two of the 8 lineages were highly associated with transient 
      introductions of foreign viruses, and 2 of the 3 endemic lineages covered the entire 
      study period. We found evidence of temporal-geographical clustering only within the 
      3 endemic lineages. The phylogeography analysis combined with serotype-specific 
      incidence data showed that transmission of a DENV serotype in a given location and 
      time is usually correlated with the absence of the other serotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study shows the cotransmission of DENV-3 lineages through a complex dissemination 
      pattern dissimilar to the evolutionary dynamics of the other serotypes in the 
      island. High virus genetic diversity and a large naive population were underlying 
      factors in the expansion and collapse of DENV-3 in Puerto Rico.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is associated to exacerbated inflammatory response and 
      structural and functional alterations in the vascular endothelium. However, the 
      mechanisms underlying DENV-induced endothelial cell activation and their role in the 
      inflammatory response were not investigated so far. We demonstrated that human brain 
      microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) are susceptible to DENV infection, which 
      induces the expression of the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor (PRR) RIG-I. 
      Infection of HBMECs promoted an increase in the production of type I IFN and 
      proinflammatory cytokines, which were abolished after RIG-I silencing. DENV-infected 
      HBMECs also presented a higher ICAM-1 expression dependent on RIG-I activation as 
      well. On the other hand, ablation of RIG-I did not interfere with virus replication. 
      Our data suggest that RIG-I activation by DENV may participate in the disease 
      pathogenesis through the modulation of cytokine release and expression of adhesion 
      molecules, probably contributing to leukocyte recruitment and amplification of the 
      inflammatory response.

TI  - Optimization of Dengue-3 recombinant NS1 protein expression in E. coli and in vitro 
      refolding for diagnostic applications.
PG  - 219-30
LID - 10.1007/s11262-012-0851-5 [doi]
AB  - Dengue non-structural protein (NS1) is known to be protective antigen and also has 
      immense application for serodiagnosis. Several serodiagnostic assays available for 
      dengue viral infection are dependent on tissue culture-grown viral proteins. This 
      task is unsafe, laborious, more expensive that makes it unsuitable for routine 
      large-scale production. Although bacterial expression is relatively simple and easy 
      for recombinant protein expression, it is more challenging to make NS1 protein with 
      native structural and immunological features using bacterial expression system. We 
      have successfully developed a method leading to the purification and refolding of 
      recombinant dengue virus type 3 (DENV3) NS1. The gene encoding NS1 was amplified and 
      cloned in pET28a (+) vector. In order to increase the purity of the recombinant NS1, 
      the transgene was engineered to carry 6× Histidine tags at both N and C-terminal 
      ends. The recombinant construct (pETNS1) was transformed into E. coli Rosetta-gami 
      cells and the expression conditions viz IPTG concentration, media type, temperature, 
      and harvest time were optimized. The size of the expressed protein was found to be 
      ~45 kDa and the authenticity of the expressed protein was confirmed using anti-His 
      and anti-NS1 monoclonal antibodies. The NS1 protein was purified under denaturing 
      conditions, to attain the native conformation, NS1 protein was in vitro refolded and 
      dialyzed. The refolded NS1 protein was detected by commercial Immuno chromatographic 
      strip and NS1 specific monoclonal antibodies. IgM antibody capture ELISA was 
      performed using refolded recombinant NS1 protein which recognized the IgM antibodies 
      in dengue-positive samples of acute phase of infection. Our result suggests that 
      rNS1 protein has immense diagnostic potential and can be used in developing point of 
      care diagnostic assays.

TI  - Infection of bone marrow cells by dengue virus in vivo.
PG  - 250-259.e4
LID - 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.11.011 [doi]
AB  - Abnormal bone marrow (BM) suppression is one of the hallmarks of dengue virus (DENV) 
      infection in patients. Although the etiology remains unclear, direct viral targeting 
      of the BM has been reasoned to be a contributing factor. The present studies were 
      carried out in an effort to determine the potential effect of DENV infection on the 
      cellularity of BM using a previously established nonhuman primate model of 
      DENV-induced coagulopathy. BM aspirates were collected at various times from the 
      infected nonhuman primate and cells were phenotypically defined and isolated using 
      standard flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting). These isolated cells 
      were subjected to detection of DENV utilizing quantitative real-time reverse 
      transcription polymerase chain reaction, electron microscopy, and immunostaining 
      techniques. DENV RNA was detectable by quantitative real-time reverse transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction in BM specimens and the presence of DENV-like particles 
      within platelet was confirmed by electron microscopy. Enumeration of BM cells 
      revealed a transient surge in cellularity at day 1, followed by a gradual decline 
      from days 2 to 10 post infection. Detailed phenotypic studies showed similar 
      kinetics in the frequencies of CD41(+)CD61(+) cells, regardless of CD34 and CD45 
      expression. The CD61(+) cells were not only the predominant cells that stained for 
      DENV antigen but fluorescence-activated cell sorting-assisted isolation of CD61(+) 
      cells from the BM were shown to contain infectious DENV by coculture with Vero 
      cells. These data support the view that intravenous infection of nonhuman primate 
      with DENV leads to direct infection of the BM, which is likely to be a contributing 
      factor for transient cell suppression in the peripheral blood characteristic of 
      acute DENV infection.

TI  - Genetic and phenotypic characterization of sylvatic dengue virus type 4 strains.
PG  - 58-67
LID - 10.1016/j.virol.2011.11.018 [doi]
AB  - Four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV 1-4) currently circulate between humans and 
      domestic/peridomestic Aedes mosquitoes, resulting in 100 million infections per 
      year. All four serotypes emerged, independently, from sylvatic progenitors 
      transmitted among non-human primates by arboreal Aedes mosquitoes. This study 
      investigated the genetic and phenotypic changes associated with emergence of human 
      DENV-4 from its sylvatic ancestors. Analysis of complete genomes of 3 sylvatic and 4 
      human strains revealed high conservation of both the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions 
      but considerable divergence within the open reading frame. Additionally, the two 
      ecotypes did not differ significantly in replication dynamics in cultured human 
      liver (Huh-7), monkey kidney (Vero) or mosquito (C6/36) cells, although significant 
      inter-strain variation within ecotypes was detected. These findings are in partial 
      agreement with previous studies of DENV-2, where human strains produced a larger 
      number of progeny than sylvatic strains in human liver cells but not in monkey or 
      mosquito cells.

TI  - Occurrence of natural vertical transmission of dengue-2 and dengue-3 viruses in 
      Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil.
PG  - e41386
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0041386 [doi]
LID - e41386
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus perform an important role in the 
      transmission of the dengue virus to human populations, particularly in the tropical 
      and subtropical regions of the world. Despite a lack of understanding in relation to 
      the maintenance of the dengue virus in nature during interepidemic periods, the 
      vertical transmission of the dengue virus in populations of A. aegypti and A. 
      albopictus appears to be of significance in relation to the urban scenario of 
      Fortaleza. METHODS: From March 2007 to July 2009 collections of larvae and pupae of 
      Aedes spp were carried out in 40 neighborhoods of Fortaleza. The collections yielded 
      3,417 (91%) A. aegypti mosquitoes and 336 (9%) A. albopictus mosquitoes. Only pools 
      containing females, randomly chosen, were submitted to the following tests indirect 
      immunofluorescence (virus isolation), RT-PCR/nested-PCR and nucleotide sequencing at 
      the C-prM junction of the dengue virus genome. RESULTS: The tests on pool 34 (35 A. 
      albopictus mosquitoes) revealed with presence of DENV-3, pool 35 (50 A. aegypti 
      mosquitoes) was found to be infected with DENV-2, while pool 49 (41 A. albopictus 
      mosquitoes) revealed the simultaneous presence of DENV-2 and DENV-3. Based on the 
      results obtained, there was a minimum infection rate of 0.5 for A. aegypti and 9.4 
      for A. albopictus. The fragments of 192 bp and 152 bp related to DENV-3, obtained 
      from pools 34 and 49, was registered in GenBank with the access codes HM130699 and 
      JF261696, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study recorded the first natural evidence 
      of the vertical transmission of the dengue virus in populations of A. aegypti and A. 
      albopictus collected in Fortaleza, Ceará State, Brazil, opening a discuss on the 
      epidemiological significance of this mechanism of viral transmission in the local 
      scenario, particularly with respect to the maintenance of these viruses in nature 
      during interepidemic periods.

TI  - Phylogenetic characterization of Dengue virus type 2 in Espírito Santo, Brazil.
PG  - 71-80
LID - 10.1007/s11033-011-0711-8 [doi]
AB  - Over the last decade, the Espírito Santo State, Brazil has become an endemic Dengue 
      fever location with annual outbreaks of varying magnitude. It is still unclear which 
      geographical route allowed the virus entry in the state and how it has genetically 
      changed since then. Therefore we have set out to study the local molecular 
      constitution of the virus and determine phylogenetic similarities and differences 
      with other Brazilian locations, as well as locations worldwide. Viral envelope genes 
      were partially sequenced from Dengue patients during the 2009 epidemic. We were able 
      to determine that local strains were of American/Asian genotype and closely related 
      to viruses circulating in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo states during the 2007, 2008 
      and 2009 epidemics. Genetic divergence analysis showed that the American/Asian 
      genotype is evolutionarily closer to the Asian II genotype and distant from the 
      Sylvatic genotype. Sequenced strains were not 100% similar and showed a high 
      evolutionary conservation of the fusion peptide in the dimerization domain of E 
      protein. This is the first molecular description of circulating Dengue virus strains 
      in the Espírito Santo State, Brazil and should help monitor and control local Dengue 
      outbreaks.

AB  - Malaria and dengue fever are the most prevalent vector-borne diseases worldwide. 
      This study aims to describe the clinical profile of patients with molecular 
      diagnosis of concurrent malaria and dengue fever in a tropical-endemic area. Eleven 
      patients with concurrent dengue virus (DENV) and Plasmodium vivax infection are 
      reported. Similar frequencies of DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 were found, including 
      DENV-3/DENV-4 co-infection. In eight patients, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
      criteria for severe malaria could be fulfilled (jaundice being the most common). 
      Only one patient met severe dengue criteria, but warning signs were present in 10. 
      Syndromic surveillance systems must be ready to identify this condition to avoid 
      misinterpretation of severity attributed to a single disease.

PG  - 294-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1708-8305.2012.00640.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In temperate countries, where the competent vector is present, the risk 
      of introduction and transmission of Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Dengue (DENV) cases is 
      particularly high. Thus, epidemiological surveillance is crucial to rapidly identify 
      imported cases in order to introduce measures to reduce mosquito density in the 
      area. METHODS: We analyze imported cases of CHIKV and DENV reported to the National 
      Institute of Health (ISS) and the Ministry of Health, from January 2008 through 
      October 2011 within the National Surveillance system in Italy. Moreover, considering 
      the worldwide spread of DENV and CHIKV and the consequent importation of cases in 
      Italy we estimate the number of imported cases using data on airport arrivals of 
      travelers to the Italian international airports. RESULTS: From January 2008 to 
      October 2011 a total of 130 cases of DENV/CHIKV were reported in travelers returning 
      to Italy. In our study, 42.8% of CHIKV cases were imported from Indian Ocean Islands 
      (Mauritius, Maldives, Bali, and Sri Lanka), whereas, for DENV 40.4% of imported 
      cases reported to have visited Asia within the incubation period. The estimated 
      number of exposed travelers to CHIKV and DENV arriving in Italy was higher compared 
      to notified cases, suggesting a possible underestimation of the real number of 
      imported cases. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated human and entomological surveillance is 
      crucial to monitor the spread of emerging vector-borne diseases and to implement 
      public health measures in order to avoid transmission and control such diseases in 
      humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Dengue cases, traditionally classified as dengue fever (DF) or 
      dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) by the World Health Organization (WHO) dengue 
      classification 1997 scheme, are categorized into Group A (without warning signs), 
      Group B [with warning signs (e.g., abdominal pain/vomiting/fluid 
      accumulation/mucosal bleeding/lethargy/liver enlargement/increasing hematocrit with 
      decreasing platelets)], or Group C (severe plasma leakage/severe bleeding/organ 
      failure) by the WHO 2009 version. We compared differences in clinical/laboratory 
      features between patients separately classified as DF/DHF and in Group A/B/C. 
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of dengue patients diagnosed between 
      2008 and 2010. RESULTS: A total of 148 adult patients (119 DF/29 DHF; 64 Group A/77 
      Group B/7 Group C) were included. Compared with DF, significantly younger age, lower 
      hospitalization rate, and higher platelet count were found in Group A. Compared with 
      DHF, higher platelet count was found in Group B. Six of seven patients (86%) 
      classified as Group C fulfilled the criteria of DHF. A cross tabulation showed DF 
      cases were distributed in all of the severity groups stratified by the WHO dengue 
      2009 scheme (53.8% Group A/45.4% Group B/0.8% Group C); of the DHF cases, 23 (79%) 
      were categorized as Group B, and six (20.7%) as Group C. All patients in Group A 
      fell into the category DF. CONCLUSION: The WHO 2009 scheme is effective in 
      identifying severe dengue cases. Heterogeneity in severity suggests careful severity 
      discrimination in patients classified in Group B is needed. Our data suggest that it 
      is safe to treat patients classified as Group A on an outpatient basis.

TI  - Evaluation of chimeric yellow fever 17D/dengue viral replication in ticks.
PG  - 979-85
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2011.0947 [doi]
AB  - Chimeric yellow fever 17D/DENV-1-4 viruses (CYD-1-4) have been developed as a 
      tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate which is currently being evaluated in efficacy 
      trials in Asia and America. While YF 17D and DENV are mosquito-borne flaviviruses, 
      it has been shown that CYD-1-4 do not replicate after oral infection in mosquitoes 
      and are not transmitted to new hosts. To further document the risk of environmental 
      dissemination of these viruses, we evaluated the replication of CYD-1-4 in ticks, 
      the vector of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), another member of the flavivirus 
      family. Females of two hard tick species, Ixodes ricinus and Rhipicephalus 
      appendiculatus, were inoculated intracoelomically with CYD-1-4 viruses and parent 
      viruses (DENV-1-4 and YF 17D). Virus persistence and replication was assessed 2, 16, 
      and 44 days post-inoculation by plaque titration and qRT-PCR. CYD-1-4 viruses were 
      detected in I. ricinus ticks at early time points post-inoculation, but with 
      infectious titers at least 100-fold lower than those observed in TBEV-infected 
      ticks. Unlike TBEV, complete viral clearance occurred by day 44 in most ticks except 
      for CYD-2, which had a tendency to decline. In addition, while about 70% of 
      TBEV-infected I. ricinus nymphs acquired infection by co-feeding with infected tick 
      females on non-viremic hosts, no co-feeding transmission of CYD-2 virus was 
      detected. Based on these results, we conclude that the risk of dissemination of the 
      candidate vaccine viruses by tick bite is highly unlikely.

TI  - A prospective cohort study to evaluate peridomestic infection as a determinant of 
      dengue transmission: protocol.
PG  - 262
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-12-262 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vector control programs, which have focused mainly on the patient house 
      and peridomestic areas around dengue cases, have not produced the expected impact on 
      transmission. This project will evaluate the assumption that the endemic/epidemic 
      transmission of dengue begins around peridomestic vicinities of the primary cases. 
      Its objective is to assess the relationship between symptomatic dengue case exposure 
      and peridomestic infection incidence. METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective cohort study 
      will be conducted (in Tepalcingo and Axochiapan, in the state of Morelos, Mexico), 
      using the state surveillance system for the detection of incident cases. Paired 
      blood specimens will be collected from both the individuals who live with the 
      incident cases and a sample of subjects residing within a 25-meter radius of such 
      cases (exposed cohort), in order to measure dengue-specific antibodies. Other 
      subjects will be selected from areas which have not presented any incident cases 
      within 200 meters, during the two months preceding the sampling (non-exposed 
      cohort). Symptomatic/asymptomatic incident infection will be considered as the 
      dependent variable, exposure to confirmed dengue cases, as the principal variable, 
      and the socio-demographic, environmental and socio-cultural conditions of the 
      subjects, as additional explanatory variables. DISCUSSION: Results indicating a high 
      infection rate among the exposed subjects would justify the application of 
      peridomestic control measures and call for an evaluation of alternate causes for 
      insufficient program impact. On the other hand, a low incidence of 
      peridomestic-infected subjects would support the hypothesis that infection occurs 
      outside the domicile, and would thus explain why the vector control measures applied 
      in the past have exerted such a limited impact on cases incidence rates. The results 
      of the present study may therefore serve to reassess site selection for 
      interventions of this type.

PG  - 199-210
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in patients 
      with dengue and to examine their correlation with symptom severity. METHODS: In this 
      cross sectional study, 531 consecutive patients who met the World Health 
      Organization criteria for dengue fever admitted to Mayo Hospital, Lahore between 
      September and November 2011 were administered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale (HADS). In addition to the HADS, the severity of their symptoms, like 
      headache, myalgias/arthralgias, fever, and retro/periorbital pain, was assessed on a 
      3-point scale (mild, moderate, and severe). RESULTS: About 60% of the patients in 
      our study met the criteria for anxiety and 62.2% of the patients met criteria for 
      depression. Severity of fever, headache, myalgias and arthralgias, and 
      retro/periorbital pain was positively correlated with both anxiety (Correlation 
      coefficients: 0.148, 0.247, 0.184, 0.184 respectively and P < 0.01 for all) and 
      depression scores (Correlation coefficients: 0.098, 0.154, 0.131, 0.125 respectively 
      and P value < 0.01 for all). The strongest correlation was found between severity of 
      headache and scores for both anxiety and depression. Both mean anxiety and 
      depression scores were significantly higher in patients with platelet count below 
      median (30,000/mm3) than in patients with platelet count above median (9.1 +/- 4.7 
      vs 8.2 +/- 4.7, P < 0.03, and 9.5 +/- 4.5 vs 8.5 +/- 4.5, P < 0.01, respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: A majority of patients with dengue have anxiety and depression symptoms. 
      Psychiatric evaluation should be done in all Dengue patients so timely treatment can 
      be initiated.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The pathophysiological changes that determine the severity of dengue 
      are still not well known, therefore it is important to study the probable 
      relationship with the host genetic. METHODS: We analyzed the possible association 
      between the FcγRIIa polymorphism and clinical signs in individuals who suffered 
      dengue infection in 2006, using contingency tables. RESULTS: We found that bleeding 
      was significantly associated to FcγRIIa H/H131 genotype (80%). CONCLUSION: Our 
      results suggest that in clinical dengue infection the bleeding could be associated

TI  - Wolbachia strain wMel induces cytoplasmic incompatibility and blocks dengue 
      transmission in Aedes albopictus.
PG  - 255-60
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1112021108 [doi]
AB  - Wolbachia inherited bacteria are able to invade insect populations using cytoplasmic 
      incompatibility and provide new strategies for controlling mosquito-borne tropical 
      diseases, such as dengue. The overreplicating wMelPop strain was recently shown to 
      strongly inhibit the replication of dengue virus when introduced into Aedes aegypti 
      mosquitoes, as well as to stimulate chronic immune up-regulation. Here we show that 
      stable introduction of the wMel strain of Drosophila melanogaster into Aedes 
      albopictus, a vector of dengue and other arboviruses, abolished the transmission 
      capacity of dengue virus-challenged mosquitoes. Immune up-regulation was observed in 
      the transinfected line, but at a much lower level than that previously found for 
      transinfected Ae. aegypti. Transient infection experiments suggest that this 
      difference is related to Ae. albopictus immunotolerance of Wolbachia, rather than to 
      the Wolbachia strain used. This study provides an example of strong pathogen 
      inhibition in a naturally Wolbachia-infected mosquito species, demonstrating that 
      this inhibition is not limited to naturally naïve species, and suggests that the 
      Wolbachia strain is more important than host background for viral inhibition. 
      Complete bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility was observed with WT strains 
      infected with the naturally occurring Ae. albopictus Wolbachia, and this provides a 
      mechanism for introducing wMel into natural populations of this species.

AB  - At the end of 2009, 21,313 cases of dengue-3 virus (DENV-3) were reported in the 
      islands of Cape Verde, an archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean 570 km from the 
      coast of western Africa. It was the first dengue outbreak ever reported in Cape 
      Verde. Mosquitoes collected in July 2010 in the city of Praia, on the island of 
      Santiago, were identified morphologically as Aedes aegypti formosus. Using 
      experimental oral infections, we found that this vector showed a moderate ability to 
      transmit the epidemic dengue-3 virus, but was highly susceptible to chikungunya and 
      yellow fever viruses.

TI  - Mortality trend by dengue in Mexico 1980 to 2009.
PG  - 444-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the mortality of dengue in Mexico during 1980 to 2009. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dengue mortality data for Mexico were obtained from Instituto 
      Nacional de Estadistica, Geografía e Informática. We used standardized and 
      non-standardized dengue mortality rates per 1,000,000 people and determined the 
      mortality trend. The groups were based on International Classification of Diseases 
      coding criteria (ICD-9 E061 and ICD-10 A91X). The results were stratified by age 
      groups and the frequencies of dengue deaths were compared using relative risk (RR) 
      with its 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: During 1980 to 2009 in Mexico, 549 deaths 
      due to dengue were reported. We found an important variation in the mortality rates 
      during the years studied. We were able to identify three periods: 1980 to 1992, 1994 
      to 2000, and 2001 to 2009. The mortality rates found are from 0.88/1,000,000 through 
      0.00/1,000,000. The average mortality rates by decade: 1980 to 1989: 0.53/1,000,000; 
      1990 to 1999: 0.06/1,000,000; 2000 to 2009: 0.12/1,000,000. In the analysis of 
      mortality by community size during 2000 to 2009, we observed in the small 
      communities with < 2,499 people, the risk is 1.25 times higher than in those with 
      more than 20,000 people. CONCLUSIONS: We found, in general, a sustained decline in 
      the number of deaths by dengue over the last 30 years in Mexico. However, a slow 
      increase was observed since 1994, which may be related to the circulation of DENV2 
      and DENV3, among other factors. We need to strengthen prevention programs in smaller 
      communities (< 2,499) where we found a higher risk of mortality due to dengue.

LID - 10.1111/j.1708-8305.2012.00628.x [doi]
AB  - Febrile exanthema is a common symptom in returning travelers. In addition to 
      cosmopolitan diseases, etiologies specific to the visited country must be 
      considered. As an accurate diagnosis is important, clinical suspicion should be 
      confirmed by laboratory tests. The case reports of three brothers returning from 
      Indonesia highlight the possibility of misdiagnosis due to the clinical similarity 
      and serological cross reactivity of dengue fever and measles.

TI  - Retro peptide-hybrids as selective inhibitors of the Dengue virus NS2B-NS3 protease.
PG  - 72-9
LID - 10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.02.008 [doi]
AB  - New chemotherapeutics against Dengue virus and related flaviviruses are of growing 
      interest in antiviral drug discovery. The viral serine protease NS2B-NS3 is a 
      promising target for the development of such agents. Drug-like inhibitors of this 
      protease with high affinity to the target are not available at the moment. The 
      present work describes the discovery of new retro di- and tripeptide hybrids that do 
      not necessarily require an electrophilic "warhead" to achieve affinities in the low 
      micromolar range. The most active sequence in this series is the tripeptide 
      R-Arg-Lys-Nle-NH(2). By variation of the N-terminal groups (R) it could be shown 
      that the previously described arylcyanoacrylamide moiety is a preferable group in 
      this position. Retro tripeptide hybrids were found to be more active and more 
      selective than retro dipeptide hybrids. A significant selectivity towards the Dengue 
      virus protease could be shown in a counterscreen with thrombin and the West Nile 
      virus protease. Alternative sequences to R-Arg-Lys-Nle-NH(2) did not have higher 
      affinities towards the Dengue virus protease, similar to retro-inverse sequences 
      with D-lysine and D-arginine residues. The results of a competition assay with the 
      known inhibitor aprotinin indicate that the N-terminal arylcyanoacrylamide residue 
      of this compound class binds near the catalytic center of the enzyme.

PG  - 518-22
LID - S1020-49892012000600011 [pii]
AB  - The Environmental School Program (PEA, for its Spanish acronym), a dengue control 
      initiative focused on primary schools that took place during 2005-2010 in several 
      cities in Honduras, is described. The environmental health program was designed to 
      increase knowledge and develop skills in the identification and control of Aedes 
      aegypti breeding sites, as well as in water and solid waste management. The results, 
      as measured by behavioral change and reduced larval indices, were satisfactory in 
      the majority of the participating schools. The initiative involved not only 
      children, but also their parents and teachers. In addition to reducing larval 
      indices, PEA was successful in promoting community participation in environmental 
      issues, particularly Aedes control. The inclusion of this educational content in the 
      primary school curriculum in Honduras remains pending.

AB  - It is well-known that the distribution of immunity in a population dictates the 
      future incidence of infectious disease, but this process is generally understood at 
      individual or macroscales. For example, herd immunity to multiple pathogens has been 
      observed at national and city levels. However, the effects of population immunity 
      have not previously been shown at scales smaller than the city (e.g., 
      neighborhoods). In particular, no study has shown long-term effects of population 
      immunity at scales consistent with the spatial scale of person-to-person 
      transmission. Here, we use the location of dengue patients' homes in Bangkok with 
      the serotype of the infecting pathogen to investigate the spatiotemporal 
      distribution of disease risk at small spatial scales over a 5-y period. We find 
      evidence for localized transmission at distances of under 1 km. We also observe 
      patterns of spatiotemporal dependence consistent with the expected impacts of 
      homotypic immunity, heterotypic immunity, and immune enhancement of disease at these 
      distances. Our observations indicate that immunological memory of dengue serotypes 
      occurs at the neighborhood level in this large urban setting. These methods have 
      broad applications to studying the spatiotemporal structure of disease risk where 
      pathogen serotype or genetic information is known.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is considered one of the most common mosquito borne illnesses in 
      the world. Although its clinical course is usually uneventful, complications have 
      rarely been known to arise. These include neurological manifestations such as 
      neuropathies. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a middle aged patient from urban Sri 
      Lanka who developed diaphragmatic paralysis secondary to phrenic neuropathy a month 
      after recovering from dengue fever. He was managed conservatively and made a full 
      recovery subsequently. CONCLUSION: Isolated phrenic nerve palsy causing 
      diaphragmatic paralysis should be considered a recognized complication of Dengue 
      fever. A patient usually gains full recovery with conservative management.

AB  - The performance of the novel commercial test ASSURE® Dengue IgA Rapid test (MP 
      Diagnostics) was evaluated using a panel of 172 sera collected from dengue patients 
      and 47 sera from healthy blood donors. The overall specificity and sensitivity were 
      61.0% and 85.1%, respectively. However, the positivity rate for IgA went from 33.3% 
      for sera collected the same day of fever onset to 81.2% for sera collected 5 days 
      after fever onset. Infections with serotype 2 viruses were detected more efficiently 
      than those with serotype 1 viruses, and no sera from infections with serotypes 3 and 
      4 were available. In addition, the kit was twice more efficient at detecting 
      secondary infections than at detecting primary infections. Finally, the ASSURE® test 
      showed good repeatability and reproducibility. The results of this study suggest 
      that the ASSURE® Dengue IgA Rapid test may become a useful and easy-to-use test for 
      early dengue diagnosis.

TI  - The impact of insecticide-treated school uniforms on dengue infections in 
      school-aged children: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial in Thailand.
PG  - 212
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-13-212 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to protect children against dengue since this 
      age group is particularly sensitive to the disease. Since dengue vectors are active 
      mainly during the day, a potential target for control should be schools where 
      children spend a considerable amount of their day. School uniforms are the cultural 
      norm in most developing countries, worn throughout the day. We hypothesise that 
      insecticide-treated school uniforms will reduce the incidence of dengue infection in 
      school-aged children. Our objective is to determine the impact of impregnated school 
      uniforms on dengue incidence. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial will be 
      conducted in eastern Thailand in a group of schools with approximately 2,000 
      students aged 7-18 years. Pre-fabricated school uniforms will be commercially 
      treated to ensure consistent, high-quality insecticide impregnation with permethrin. 
      A double-blind, randomised, crossover trial at the school level will cover two 
      dengue transmission seasons. DISCUSSION: Practical issues and plans concerning 
      intervention implementation, evaluation, analysing and interpreting the data, and 
      possible policy implications arising from the trial are discussed. TRIAL

AB  - An assessment of the household wastes as larval habitats of the dengue vectors was 
      made considering Kolkata, India, as geographical area. Wastes of four major 
      categories, namely, earthen, porcelain, plastic and coconut shells were monitored 
      for positive with immature of either Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus. Twenty six 
      types of wastes with varying size and shape, resembling containers, were identified 
      that hosted mosquito immature. The number of waste containers positive for Aedes 
      immature varied significantly (P<0.05) with respect to location, type and month. The 
      relative density of Aedes immature in the waste containers varied significantly 
      (P<0.05) with the types and months. The significant interaction between the month, 
      waste container types and density of Aedes immature suggest that the household 
      wastes are important contributors to the maintenance of the population of Aedes 
      mosquito in the city. Based on the relative density of mosquito immature in the 
      wastes, cluster analysis allowed segregation and classification of the wastes and 
      their importance as mosquito larval habitats. Apparently, the containers that are 
      most frequently disposed off contributed largely to the sustenance of Aedes mosquito 
      population in the city. This calls for a strict legislation towards disposal as well 
      as enhanced management of the household wastes. A link between the wastes disposed 
      and subsequent conversion to the mosquito larval habitats cautions for continuance 
      of Aedes population and possibility of dengue epidemics if the existing management 
      practices are not improved.

AB  - The envelope (E) protein of dengue virus (DENV) is composed of three domains (EDI, 
      EDII, EDIII) and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Many monoclonal 
      antibodies that bind EDIII strongly neutralize DENV. However in vitro studies 
      indicate that anti-EDIII antibodies contribute little to the neutralizing potency of 
      human DENV-immune serum. In this study, we assess the role of anti-EDIII antibodies 
      in mouse and human DENV-immune serum in neutralizing or enhancing DENV infection in 
      mice. We demonstrate that EDIII-depleted human DENV-immune serum was protective 
      against homologous DENV infection in vivo. Although EDIII-depleted DENV-immune mouse 
      serum demonstrated decreased neutralization potency in vitro, reduced protection in 
      some organs, and enhanced disease in vivo, administration of increased volumes of 
      EDIII-depleted serum abrogated these effects. These data indicate that anti-EDIII 
      antibodies contribute to protection and minimize enhancement when present, but can 
      be replaced by neutralizing antibodies targeting other epitopes on the dengue 
      virion.

AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) envelope (E) protein mediates virus entry into cells via 
      interaction with a range of cell-surface receptor molecules. Cell-surface 
      glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have been shown to play an early role in this interaction, 
      and charged oligosaccharides such as heparin bind to the E protein. We have examined 
      this interaction using site-directed mutagenesis of a recombinant form of the 
      putative receptor-binding domain III of the DENV-2E protein expressed as an MBP 
      (maltose-binding protein)-fusion protein. Using an ELISA-based GAG-binding assay, 
      cell-based binding analysis and antiviral-activity assays, we have identified two 
      critical residues, K291 and K295, that are involved in GAG interactions. These 
      studies have also demonstrated differential binding between mosquito and human 
      cells.

AB  - Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) is usually associated with 
      neuromyelitis optica and other autoimmune and inflammatory disorders but this is the 
      first report linking it with dengue fever. Dengue infection can cause a variety of 
      neurological complications which may result in poor recovery and long-term 
      disability. The authors report here a patient who developed LETM in the 
      para-infectious stage of dengue fever. The patient had a complicated clinical course 
      resulting in severe paraparesis and urinary retention. Treatment with 
      immunoglobulins and antiviral agents supported by a spell of early intensive 
      rehabilitation programme produced excellent results in terms of recovery.

TI  - Constraints on the use of lifespan-shortening Wolbachia to control dengue fever.
PG  - 26-32
LID - 10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.12.006 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever, a viral disease spread by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, affects 50-100 
      million people a year in many tropical countries. Because the virus must incubate 
      within mosquito hosts for two weeks before being able to transmit the infection, 
      shortening the lifespan of mosquitoes may curtail dengue transmission. We developed 
      a continuous time reaction-diffusion model of the spatial spread of Wolbachia 
      through a population of A. aegypti. This model incorporates the lifespan-shortening 
      effects of Wolbachia on infected A. aegypti and the fitness advantage to infected 
      females due to cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). We found that local establishment 
      of the Wolbachia infection can occur if the fitness advantage due to CI exceeds the 
      fitness reduction due to lifespan-shortening effects, in accordance with earlier 
      results concerning fecundity reduction. However, spatial spread is possible only if 
      the fitness advantage due to CI is twice as great as the fitness reduction due to 
      lifespan shortening effects. Moreover, lifespan-shortening and fecundity-reduction 
      can have different effects on the speed of wave-retreat. Using data from the 
      literature, we estimated all demographic parameters for infected and uninfected 
      mosquitoes and computed the velocities of spread of infection. Our most optimistic 
      estimates suggest that the spatial spread of lifespan-shortening Wolbachia may be so 
      slow that efficient spatial spread would require a prohibitively large number of 
      point releases. However, as these estimates of demographic parameters may not 
      accurately reflect natural conditions, further research is necessary to corroborate 
      these predictions.

TI  - Dengue viremia in blood donors identified by RNA and detection of dengue transfusion 
      transmission during the 2007 dengue outbreak in Puerto Rico.
PG  - 1657-66
LID - 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2012.03566.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2007, a total of 10,508 suspected dengue cases were reported in 
      Puerto Rico. Blood donations were tested for dengue virus (DENV) RNA and recipients 
      of RNA-positive donations traced to assess transfusion transmission. STUDY DESIGN 
      AND METHODS: Blood donation samples from 2007 were maintained in a repository and 
      tested individually for DENV RNA by transcription-mediated amplification (TMA); a 
      subset was further tested by an enhanced TMA (eTMA) assay. TMA-reactive samples were 
      considered confirmed if TMA (including eTMA) was repeat reactive (RR). All TMA-RR 
      samples were tested by quantitative, DENV type-specific reverse 
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and for anti-DENV immunoglobulin 
      (Ig)M by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Samples positive by RT-PCR were further 
      tested for infectivity in mosquito cell culture. Patients receiving components from 
      TMA-RR donations were followed. RESULTS: Of 15,350 donation samples tested, 29 were 
      TMA-RR for a prevalence of 1 per 529 (0.19%). DENV Types 1, 2, and 3 with viral 
      titers of 10(5) to 10(9) copies/mL were detected by RT-PCR in 12 samples of which 
      all were infectious in mosquito culture. Six TMA-RR samples were IgM positive. Three 
      of the 29 recipients receiving TMA-RR donations were tested. One recipient in Puerto 
      Rico transfused with red blood cells containing 10(8) copies/mL DENV-2 became 
      febrile 3 days posttransfusion and developed dengue hemorrhagic fever. The recipient 
      was DENV-2 RNA positive by RT-PCR; both the donor and the recipient viruses had 
      identical envelope sequences. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of viremia were detected in 
      blood donors in Puerto Rico coupled with the first documented transfusion 
      transmission of severe dengue disease, suggesting that further research on 
      interventions is needed.

PG  - 343-5

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A significant peripheral blood plasmacytosis is a rare finding 
      associated with viral infections. We reported five consecutive cases of dengue virus 
      infection, with circulating plasma cells. CASE REPORTS: Three women and two men, 
      aged 26 to 75 years, had returned from French West Indies less than one week before 
      the onset of the symptoms (mean: 2.5 days). The transient blood plasmacytosis was 
      variable in intensity (0.1 to 0.8 G/L) with a maximal level between the fourth and 
      the seventh day following the onset of the symptoms, and was associated in four 
      patients, with activated lymphocytes and lympho-plasma cells. CONCLUSION: Reactive 
      plasmacytosis during dengue fever is common and probably underestimated because it 
      is transient and only identified by careful microscopic examination of a blood 
      smear. Plasmacytosis could be explained by the intensity of the immunological 
      response and the production of large amount of interleukins.

TI  - Space-time analysis of hospitalised dengue patients in rural Thailand reveals 
      important temporal intervals in the pattern of dengue virus transmission.
PG  - 1076-85

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the temporal intervals at which spatial clustering of dengue 
      hospitalisations occurs. METHODS: Space-time analysis of 262 people hospitalised and 
      serologically confirmed with dengue virus infections in Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand was 
      performed. The cases were observed between 1 January 2009 and 6 May 2011. Spatial 
      coordinates of each patient's home were captured using the Global Positioning 
      System. A novel method based on the Knox test was used to determine the temporal 
      intervals between cases at which spatial clustering occurred. These intervals are 
      indicative of the length of time between successive illnesses in the chain of dengue 
      virus transmission. RESULTS: The strongest spatial clustering occurred at the 
      15-17-day interval. There was also significant spatial clustering over short 
      intervals (2-5 days). The highest excess risk was observed within 200 m of a 
      previous hospitalised case and significantly elevated risk persisted within this 
      distance for 32-34 days. CONCLUSIONS: Fifteen to seventeen days are the most likely 
      serial interval between successive dengue illnesses. This novel method relies only 
      on passively detected, hospitalised case data with household locations and provides 
      a useful tool for understanding region-specific and outbreak-specific dengue virus 
      transmission dynamics.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen for which no vaccine or specific 
      therapeutic is available. Although it is well established that dendritic cells and 
      macrophages are primary sites of DENV replication, it remains unclear whether 
      non-hematopoietic cellular compartments serve as virus reservoirs. Here, we 
      exploited hematopoietic-specific microRNA-142 (miR-142) to control virus tropism by 
      inserting tandem target sites into the virus to restrict replication exclusively in 
      this cell population. In vivo use of this virus restricted infection of CD11b+, 
      CD11c+, and CD45+ cells, resulting in a loss of virus spread, regardless of the 
      route of administration. Furthermore, sequencing of the targeted virus population 
      that persisted at low levels, demonstrated total excision of the inserted miR-142 
      target sites. The complete conversion of the virus population under these selective 
      conditions suggests that these immune cells are the predominant sources of virus 
      amplification. Taken together, this work highlights the importance of hematopoietic 
      cells for DENV replication and showcases an invaluable tool for the study of virus 
      pathogenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the frequency of CNS infection by dengue 
      virus (DENV) in individuals with fatal outcomes. METHODS: Samples of 150 individuals 
      suspect of an infection disease and with fatal outcomes were investigated for 
      evidence of the presence of DENV. The sampling was made up of 150 CSF, 120 tissue 
      samples, and 109 blood specimens. The tests used were viral isolation, reverse 
      transcriptase PCR, immunohistochemistry, nonstructural 1 antigen, and immunoglobulin 
      M detection. RESULTS: Out of 150 studied patients, 84 were dengue positive. Evidence 
      of the presence of DENV was found in 41 CSF, showing the following neurologic 
      diagnosis: 46.3% encephalitis, 34.1% meningoencephalitis, and 19.5% meningitis, 
      giving a frequency of 48.8% of the 84 dengue-positive cases. The major clinical 
      manifestations observed on these individuals were fever, headache, mental 
      irritability, breathless, vomiting, muscle pain, tiredness, abdominal pain, 
      somnolence, restlessness, dizziness, cough, seizure, coma, and neck stiffness. 
      CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations and laboratory-positive results in CSF that may 
      indicate the presence of DENV led to consider the invasion of CNS by DENV in these 
      fatal cases studied, and showed that neurologic pathology was an important fatal 
      complication in dengue cases.

TI  - Spatial patterns and socioecological drivers of dengue fever transmission in 
      Queensland, Australia.

LID - 10.1289/ehp.1003270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding how socioecological factors affect the transmission of 
      dengue fever (DF) may help to develop an early warning system of DF. OBJECTIVES: We 
      examined the impact of socioecological factors on the transmission of DF and 
      assessed potential predictors of locally acquired and overseas-acquired cases of DF 
      in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: We obtained data from Queensland Health on the 
      numbers of notified DF cases by local government area (LGA) in Queensland for the 
      period 1 January 2002 through 31 December 2005. Data on weather and the 
      socioeconomic index were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the 
      Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. A Bayesian spatial conditional 
      autoregressive model was fitted at the LGA level to quantify the relationship 
      between DF and socioecological factors. RESULTS: Our estimates suggest an increase 
      in locally acquired DF of 6% [95% credible interval (CI): 2%, 11%] and 61% (95% CI: 
      2%, 241%) in association with a 1-mm increase in average monthly rainfall and a 1°C 
      increase in average monthly maximum temperature between 2002 and 2005, respectively. 
      By contrast, overseas-acquired DF cases increased by 1% (95% CI: 0%, 3%) and by 1% 
      (95% CI: 0%, 2%) in association with a 1-mm increase in average monthly rainfall and 
      a 1-unit increase in average socioeconomic index, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Socioecological factors appear to influence the transmission of DF in Queensland, 
      but the drivers of locally acquired and overseas-acquired DF may differ. DF risk is 
      spatially clustered with different patterns for locally acquired and 
      overseas-acquired cases.

TI  - A small-molecule inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 inhibits Dengue virus 
      replication.
PG  - 103-6
LID - 10.1016/j.virusres.2012.01.009 [doi]
AB  - The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a key player in maintaining cellular 
      protein homeostasis and is associated with various human diseases, including 
      neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and infectious diseases. Viruses from several 
      families reprogram the UPS to make the cellular environment conducive to viral 
      replication, and inhibition of the UPS interferes with viral propagation. Here we 
      show that IU1, a small-molecule inhibitor of the proteasome-associated 
      deubiquitinating enzyme USP14, inhibits replication of several flaviviruses. IU1 has 
      been shown to enhance proteasome activity, an effect that may underlie its influence 
      on flavivirus propagation. Inhibition of dengue virus replication was more 
      pronounced than other flaviviruses used in the study. These results open new targets 
      for therapeutic intervention against viruses from multiple families.

      interviews were conducted with leading figures in public health, urban planning and 
      governance in the planned city of Putrajaya, Malaysia. Drawing on theories of urban 
      political ecology and ecosocial epidemiology, the qualitative study found the health 
      of place - expressed as dengue-bearing mosquitoes and dengue fever in human bodies 
      in the urban environment - was influenced by the place of health in a hierarchy of 
      urban priorities.

TI  - The serotype-independent but concentration-dependent enhancing antibodies among Thai 
      dengue patients.
PG  - 624-33
AB  - Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) is central to explaining the 
      development of severe disease at the end of post-dengue virus infection. 
      Non-neutralizing anti-dengue antibodies bound to the dengue virion enhances the 
      virus entrance into the target cells via the Fc receptor. The titer of enhancing 
      antibodies in dengue patients is not determined during dengue virus infection. 
      Sensitive flow cytometry detecting dengue virus-infected K562 cells was used to 
      quantitate enhancing activity among Thai DF and DHF patients against four serotypes 
      and the patient's dengue isolate. The titer was defined as the reciprocal of the 
      final dilution that loses enhancing activity. The serum of Thai patients confirmed 
      to have dengue infection were found to have high titers of enhancing antibodies and 
      increased gradually through the convalescent phase of infection. The enhancing 
      antibody titers were not different among the four serotypes or from the infecting 
      isolate. The anti-dengue antibodies from dengue patients can enhance dengue virus 
      infections in a concentration-dependent, serotype-independent manner.

AB  - An optimal control problem for a host-vector Dengue transmission model is discussed 
      here. In the model, treatments with mosquito repellent are given to adults and 
      children and those who undergo treatment are classified in treated compartments. 
      With this classification, the model consists of 11 dynamic equations. The basic 
      reproductive ratio that represents the epidemic indicator is obtained from the 
      largest eigenvalue of the next generation matrix. The optimal control problem is 
      designed with four control parameters, namely the treatment rates for children and 
      adult compartments, and the drop-out rates from both compartments. The cost 
      functional accounts for the total number of the infected persons, the cost of the 
      treatment, and the cost related to reducing the drop-out rates. Numerical results 
      for the optimal controls and the related dynamics are shown for the case of epidemic 
      prevention and outbreak reduction strategies.

AB  - Dengue, caused by the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV), represents an expanding 
      global health challenge. The potential for serotype-cross-reactive antibodies to 
      exacerbate disease during a secondary infection with a heterologous DENV serotype 
      has driven efforts to study human DENV-specific antibodies. Most DENV-specific 
      antibodies generated in humans are serotype-cross-reactive, weakly neutralizing, and 
      directed against the immature pre-membrane (prM), envelope (E), and nonstructural 1 
      (NS1) proteins. To broaden the characterization of human DENV-specific antibodies, 
      we assessed B-cell responses by ELISpot assays and isolated B cells from the 
      peripheral blood of a human subject with previous DENV infection. Forty-eight human 
      IgG monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) were initially characterized by their potential to 
      bind to an inactivated lysate of DENV-infected cells. Subsequently, most 
      DENV-specific hMAbs were found to bind soluble, recombinant E protein (rE). Two 
      hMAbs were unable to bind rE, despite strongly binding to the DENV-infected cell 
      lysate. Further analyses showed that these two hMAbs bound conformation-dependent, 
      reduction-sensitive epitopes on E protein. These data shed light on the breadth of 
      DENV-specific hMAbs generated within a single immune donor.

AB  - In the summer of 2010, two autochthonous dengue fever cases were detected in 
      Croatia. Here we report the retrospective detection of an additional case of dengue 
      fever, representing the first sustained autochthonous transmission in Europe since 
      1928. In addition, we present the phylogenetic analyses based on two sequences from 
      the Pelješac peninsula, southern Croatia. The sequences were identified as dengue 
      virus genotype 1 and recovered from two out of the three Pelješac patients in whom 
      infection occurred.

PG  - 512-23
LID - S0124-00642012000300014 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A mathematical model is presented in this paper showing the dynamics of 
      dengue transmission. The goal was to studyAedes aegyptipopulation behaviour and that 
      of affected people to scientifically support the decision-making involved in 
      surveillance and control programmes. METHODS: The proposed mathematical model 
      involved eight differential equations having constant delays; each represented each 
      population's variation either in humans or the mosquito vector. RESULTS: Two of the 
      mathematical model's simulation scenarios are presented; they were solved by means 
      of an algorithm implemented in MATLAB software. The data was obtained from the 
      Colombian Statistics Department (DANE), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and from 
      a review of the pertinent literature. The data regarding human and vector 
      populations was analysed (with and without using controls). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      proposed mathematical model was able to simulate the dynamics of dengue 
      transmission; it simulated the population-related behaviour ofAedes aegyptiand the 
      affected people. This model could be a tool for scientifically supporting 
      surveillance and control programmes' decision-making.

TI  - Lipopolysaccharide levels are elevated in dengue virus infected patients and 
      correlate with disease severity.
PG  - 38-42
LID - 10.1016/j.jcv.2011.09.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although in the majority of cases dengue virus (DENV) infection results 
      in a self-limiting febrile disease, it can cause severe plasma leakage in a minority 
      of patients. The appearance of plasma leakage indicates an increased permeability of 
      the vascular wall. In this study we investigated if DENV infection can lead to 
      leakage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the intestine into the blood of the 
      patient, indicative of an increased permeability of the intestinal mucosal barrier. 
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate if LPS levels were elevated in 
      DENV infected patients and if these levels correlated with disease severity. STUDY 
      DESIGN: LPS levels in the blood of DENV infected children were determined using the 
      Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay. To determine disease severity we used the 1997-WHO 
      criteria, the expert physician's judgement and a score that focused on plasma 
      leakage in particular. Furthermore, the modulatory factors LPS binding protein (LBP) 
      and sCD14, as well as the immune activation marker neopterin were determined. 
      RESULTS: We showed significantly elevated LPS levels in plasma of DENV infected 
      children compared to healthy controls. The plasma leakage severity score had the 
      strongest correlation with levels of LPS. LBP, sCD14 and neopterin were elevated 
      compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSION: In this study we show evidence of elevated 
      LPS levels during DENV infection. Moreover, a correlation between LPS levels and 
      disease severity was found, especially when disease severity was determined in terms 
      of plasma leakage.

TI  - Phylogenetic relationship of dengue virus type 3 isolated in Brazil and Paraguay and 
      global evolutionary divergence dynamics.
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-9-124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease worldwide. 
      Dengue virus comprises four antigenically related viruses named dengue virus type 1 
      to 4 (DENV1-4). DENV-3 was re-introduced into the Americas in 1994 causing outbreaks 
      in Nicaragua and Panama. DENV-3 was introduced in Brazil in 2000 and then spread to 
      most of the Brazilian States, reaching the neighboring country, Paraguay in 2002. In 
      this study, we have analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of DENV-3 isolated in 
      Brazil and Paraguay with viruses isolated worldwide. We have also analyzed the 
      evolutionary divergence dynamics of DENV-3 viruses. RESULTS: The entire open reading 
      frame (ORF) of thirteen DENV-3 isolated in Brazil (n = 9) and Paraguay (n = 4) were 
      sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. DENV-3 grouped into three main genotypes (I, II 
      and III). Several internal clades were found within each genotype that we called 
      lineage and sub-lineage. Viruses included in this study belong to genotype III and 
      grouped together with viruses isolated in the Americas within the lineage III. The 
      Brazilian viruses were further segregated into two different sub-lineage, A and B, 
      and the Paraguayan into the sub-lineage B. All three genotypes showed internal 
      grouping. The nucleotide divergence was in average 6.7% for genotypes, 2.7% for 
      lineages and 1.5% for sub-lineages. Phylogenetic trees constructed with any of the 
      protein gene sequences showed the same segregation of the DENV-3 in three genotypes. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results showed that two groups of DENV-3 genotypes III circulated in 
      Brazil during 2002-2009, suggesting different events of introduction of the virus 
      through different regions of the country. In Paraguay, only one group DENV-3 
      genotype III is circulating that is very closely related to the Brazilian viruses of 
      sub-lineage B. Different degree of grouping can be observed for DENV-3 and each 
      group showed a characteristic evolutionary divergence. Finally, we have observed 
      that any protein gene sequence can be used to identify the virus genotype.

AB  - Dengue is a major international public health concern and impacts one-third of the 
      world's population. No specific vaccine and treatment are available for this 
      vector-borne disease. There are four similar but distinct serotypes of dengue 
      viruses (DENV). Infection with one serotype affords life-long immunity to that 
      serotype but only temporary partial immunity, or cross immunity (CI), to others. 
      This increases the risk of developing lethal complications upon re-infection, mainly 
      because of the effect of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). There have been 
      multiple studies of the dynamic behavior created by the interplay of ADE and CI 
      using mathematical models. However, models in the literature seldom capture the 
      vector population, which we consider important because combating the mosquito vector 
      is the only way to contain dengue transmission in the absence of vaccines. We 
      therefore propose two differential-equation models of dengue fever (DF) with 
      different levels of complexity and details. Our results support the need for ADE to 
      explain the complexity of the epidemiological data.

PG  - 164-7
AB  - Dengue is acute viral disease transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes (Ae. 
      aegypti, Ae. albopictus). Dengue virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus 
      Flavivirus. There are four dengue virus serotypes (1-4) which are maintained 
      endemically. The disease is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas between 
      latitudes 35 degrees N and 35 degrees S. Infections may be asymptomatic or may 
      produce a wide spectrum of diseases: non-specific febrile illness, dengue fever, 
      dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. For the first time in Croatia, 
      Ae. albopictus was registered in Zagreb in October 2004. In autumn 2005, additional 
      records of Ae. albopictus presence were made in many places along the Adriatic 
      coast. During 2007, two cases of imported dengue fever were reported in Croatia, 
      after which similar imported cases appeared continually. In August 2010, the first 
      autochthonous case of dengue fever was recorded on the peninsula Peljesac. Though 
      Croatia is not endemic for dengue, the existence of a corresponding vector and a 
      latent threat by imported dengue cases demand state-of-the-art and timely 
      diagnostics. The most commonly used methods in laboratory diagnosis of dengue 
      infections involve detection of viral RNA, antigen detection and serologic methods 
      (detection of antibodies).

TI  - Clinical features of dengue in a large Vietnamese cohort: intrinsically lower 
      platelet counts and greater risk for bleeding in adults than children.
PG  - e1679

AB  - BACKGROUND: As dengue spreads to new geographical regions and the force of infection 
      changes in existing endemic areas, a greater breadth of clinical presentations is 
      being recognised. Clinical experience suggests that adults manifest a pattern of 
      complications different from those observed in children, but few reports have 
      described the age-related spectrum of disease in contemporaneous groups of patients 
      recruited at the same geographical location. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using 
      detailed prospectively collected information from ongoing studies that encompass the 
      full spectrum of hospitalised dengue cases admitted to a single hospital in southern 
      Vietnam, we compared clinical and laboratory features, management, and outcome for 
      647 adults and 881 children with confirmed dengue. Signs of vascular leakage and 
      shock were more frequent and more severe in children than adults, while bleeding 
      manifestations and organ involvement were more common in adults. Additionally, 
      adults experienced significantly more severe thrombocytopenia. Secondary infection 
      but not serotype was independently associated with greater thrombocytopenia, 
      although with a smaller effect than age-group. The effect of age-group on platelet 
      count was also apparent in the values obtained several weeks after recovery, 
      indicating that healthy adults have intrinsically lower counts compared to children. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: There are clear distinctions between adults and children 
      in the pattern of complications seen in association with dengue infection, and these 
      depend partly on intrinsic age-dependent physiological differences. Knowledge of 
      such differences is important to inform research on disease pathogenesis, as well as 
      to encourage development of management guidelines that are appropriate to the 
      age-groups at risk.

AB  - Although several vaccine candidates are presently in various phases of clinical 
      trials, the field still lacks an effective tool to determine protective immunity. 
      The presence of cross-neutralizing antibodies limits a serological approach to 
      identify the etiology and distinguish lifelong from short-lived humoral protection. 
      A recent study indicated that cross-reactive but not serotype-specific antibodies 
      require high antibody concentration to co-ligate FcγRIIB and inhibit infection. 
      Here, we tested if these differences could allow us to distinguish serotype-specific 
      from cross-neutralizing antibodies. Using 30 blinded early convalescent serum 
      samples from patients with virologically confirmed dengue, we demonstrate that 
      neutralization in the presence of FcγR-mediated phagocytosis in THP-1 correctly 
      identifies the DENV serotype of the infection in 93.3% of the cases compared to 
      76.7% with plaque reduction neutralization test. Our findings could provide a new 
      approach for evaluating DENV neutralization and suggest that in addition to blocking 
      specific ligand-receptor interactions for viral entry, antibodies must prevent viral 
      uncoating during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis for complete humoral protection.

AB  - In a randomized, placebo-controlled, monocenter, observer blinded study conducted in 
      an area where dengue is endemic, we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a 
      recombinant, live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate (CYD-TDV) in 
      2-11 year-olds with varying levels of pre-existing yellow-fever immunity due to 
      vaccination 1-7 years previously. 199 children received 3 injections of CYD-TDV 
      (months 0, 6 and 12) and 99 received placebo (months 0 and 6) or pneumococcal 
      polysaccharide vaccine (month 12). One month after the third dengue vaccination, 
      serotype specific neutralizing antibody GMTs were in the range of 178-190 (1/dil) 
      (versus 16.7-38.1 in the control group), a 10-20 fold-increase from baseline, and 
      94% of vaccines were seropositive to all four serotypes (versus 39% in the control 
      group). There were no vaccine-related SAEs. The observed reactogenicity profile was 
      consistent with phase I studies, with severity grade 1-2 injection site pain, 
      headache, malaise and fever most frequently reported and no increase after 
      subsequent vaccinations. Virologically confirmed dengue cases were seen after 
      completion of the 3 doses: 1 in the CYD-TDV group (N=199), and 3 in the control 
      group (N=99). A 3-dose regimen of CYD-TDV had a good safety profile in 2-11 year 
      olds with a history of YF vaccination and elicited robust antibody responses that 
      were balanced against the four serotypes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To build up and analyse the feasibility, process, and effectiveness of a 
      partnership-driven ecosystem management intervention in reducing dengue vector 
      breeding and constructing sustainable partnerships among multiple stakeholders. 
      METHODS: A community-based intervention study was conducted from May 2009 to January 
      2010 in Yangon city. Six high-risk and six low-risk clusters were randomized and 
      allocated as intervention and routine service areas, respectively. For each cluster, 
      100 households were covered. Bi-monthly entomological evaluations (i.e. larval and 
      pupal surveys) and household acceptability surveys at the end of 6-month 
      intervention period were conducted, supplemented by qualitative evaluations. 
      Intervention description: The strategies included eco-friendly multi-stakeholder 
      partner groups (Thingaha) and ward-based volunteers, informed decision-making of 
      householders, followed by integrated vector management approach. FINDINGS: Pupae per 
      person index (PPI) decreased at the last evaluation by 5·7% (0·35-0·33) in high-risk 
      clusters. But in low-risk clusters, PPI remarkably decreased by 63·6% (0·33-0·12). 
      In routine service area, PPI also decreased due to availability of Temephos after 
      Cyclone Nargis. As for total number of pupae in all containers, when compared to 
      evaluation 1, there was a reduction of 18·6% in evaluation 2 and 44·1% in evaluation 
      3 in intervention area. However, in routine service area, more reduction was 
      observed. All intervention tools were found as acceptable, being feasible to 
      implement by multi-stakeholder partner groups. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of 
      community-controlled partnership-driven interventions was found to be superior to 
      the vertical approach in terms of sustainability and community empowerment.

TI  - Spatial dimensions of dengue virus transmission across interepidemic and epidemic 
      periods in Iquitos, Peru (1999-2003).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of spatial patterns of dengue virus (DENV) infection is 
      important for understanding transmission dynamics and guiding effective disease 
      prevention strategies. Because movement of infected humans and mosquito vectors 
      plays a role in the spread and persistence of virus, spatial dimensions of 
      transmission can range from small household foci to large community clusters. 
      Current understanding is limited because past analyses emphasized clinically 
      apparent illness and did not account for the potentially large proportion of 
      inapparent infections. In this study we analyzed both clinically apparent and 
      overall infections to determine the extent of clustering among human DENV 
      infections. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted spatial analyses at global 
      and local scales, using acute case and seroconversion data from a prospective 
      longitudinal cohort in Iquitos, Peru, from 1999-2003. Our study began during a 
      period of interepidemic DENV-1 and DENV-2 transmission and transitioned to epidemic 
      DENV-3 transmission. Infection status was determined by seroconversion based on 
      plaque neutralization testing of sequential blood samples taken at approximately 
      six-month intervals, with date of infection assigned as the middate between paired 
      samples. Each year was divided into three distinct seasonal periods of DENV 
      transmission. Spatial heterogeneity was detected in baseline seroprevalence for 
      DENV-1 and DENV-2. Cumulative DENV-3 seroprevalence calculated by trimester from 
      2001-2003 was spatially similar to preexisting DENV-1 and DENV-2 seroprevalence. 
      Global clustering (case-control Ripley's K statistic) appeared at radii of ∼200-800 
      m. Local analyses (Kuldorf spatial scan statistic) identified eight DENV-1 and 15 
      DENV-3 clusters from 1999-2003. The number of seroconversions per cluster ranged 
      from 3-34 with radii from zero (a single household) to 750 m; 65% of clusters had 
      radii >100 m. No clustering was detected among clinically apparent infections. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Seroprevalence of previously circulating DENV serotypes 
      can be a predictor of transmission risk for a different invading serotype and, thus, 
      identify targets for strategically placed surveillance and intervention. 
      Seroprevalence of a specific serotype is also important, but does not preclude other 
      contributing factors, such as mosquito density, in determining where transmission of 
      that virus will occur. Regardless of the epidemiological context or virus serotype, 
      human movement appears to be an important factor in defining the spatial dimensions 
      of DENV transmission and, thus, should be considered in the design and evaluation of 
      surveillance and intervention strategies.

TI  - Induction of IFNα or IL-12 depends on differentiation of THP-1 cells in dengue 
      infections without and with antibody enhancement.
PG  - 340
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-12-340 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Appropriate induction of the early Th1 cytokine IL-12 is a critical 
      defense directed against viral infection. We have previously shown that different 
      viruses elicited either IL-12 or IFNα dependent Th1 reactions. Using dengue-2 virus, 
      we sought to explore how dengue-2 induced IL-12 or IFNα expression by monocytic and 
      its derived dendritic cells. METHODS: We employed human monocytic cell line, THP-1, 
      to investigate whether differentiation of monocytic cells is involved in the switch 
      between IFNα and IL-12 induction. Flow cytometry, RT-PCR and ELISA were respectively 
      used to determine cell differentiation, IL-12 and IFNα mRNA expression and protein 
      production. RESULTS: THP-1, expressing CD123, which is a plasmacytoid dendritic cell 
      marker, but not CD14, CD11b or CD11c revealed IFNα mRNA expression while stimulated 
      by dengue-2. In contrast, PMA-induced THP-1 differentiation toward monocytic cells 
      expressed CD11b+, and CD14+, but not CD123, and revealed exclusively IL-12 
      expression while stimulated by dengue-2. Further studies showed that CD123+ 
      expressing THP-1 cells elicited higher IFNα expression in dose and time dependent 
      induction after infection, and PMA-induced monocytic differentiation of THP-1 cells 
      revealed IL-12 expression. Antibody-dependent enhancement of DEN-2 infection 
      significantly suppressed the DEN-2 induced IL-12 p40 expression in monocytic 
      differentiated THP-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Clarification and modulation of the early 
      Th1 reaction in different monocytic cells may change or prevent complication from 
      dengue infection.

TI  - Outbreak of dengue fever in Lahore: study of risk factors.
PG  - 99-101
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is a rapidly emerging arthropod born viral disease 
      threatening to become an international public health problem. Approximately 500,000 
      people suffer from dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome with 20,000 
      deaths annually. Objective of this study was to look into the risk factors 
      associated with the development of dengue fever. METHODS: This cross-sectional 
      descriptive study was conducted on patients admitted in various hospitals of Lahore 
      with suspected Dengue fever. Data was collected on a questionnaire from 109 
      conveniently selected patients. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 34 +/- 16.5 
      years, and majority (80, 73.4%) were male. Seropositivity for dengue was found in 78 
      (71.5%). The study did not find significant statistical association of 
      seropositivity with demographic variables. However, source of water supply was found 
      associated with dengue seropositivity (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Source of water is a 
      determinant of contracting dengue fever owing to it a breeding media for mosquitoes. 
      All other phenomena associated with use of water and sanitation needs to be part of 
      long term control of dengue that will also contribute to controlling other diseases 
      with the same determinants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant public health threat in tropical 
      and subtropical regions of the world. A therapeutic antibody against the viral 
      envelope (E) protein represents a promising immunotherapy for disease control. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We generated seventeen novel mouse monoclonal 
      antibodies (mAbs) with high reactivity against E protein of dengue virus type 2 
      (DENV-2). The mAbs were further dissected using recombinant E protein domain I-II 
      (E-DI-II) and III (E-DIII) of DENV-2. Using plaque reduction neutralization test 
      (PRNT) and mouse protection assay with lethal doses of DENV-2, we identified four 
      serotype-specific mAbs that had high neutralizing activity against DENV-2 infection. 
      Of the four, E-DIII targeting mAb DB32-6 was the strongest neutralizing mAb against 
      diverse DENV-2 strains. Using phage display and virus-like particles (VLPs) we found 
      that residue K310 in the E-DIII A-strand was key to mAb DB32-6 binding E-DIII. We 
      successfully converted DB32-6 to a humanized version that retained potency for the 
      neutralization of DENV-2 and did not enhance the viral infection. The DB32-6 showed 
      therapeutic efficacy against mortality induced by different strains of DENV-2 in two 
      mouse models even in post-exposure trials. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We used novel 
      epitope mapping strategies, by combining phage display with VLPs, to identify the 
      important A-strand epitopes with strong neutralizing activity. This study introduced 
      potential therapeutic antibodies that might be capable of providing broad protection 
      against diverse DENV-2 infections without enhancing activity in humans.

PG  - 311-22
AB  - We studied anemia and bleeding risk among hematologic-oncologic pediatric patients 
      with dengue infection. A total of 907 patients suspected of having dengue infection 
      were included in the study. They were categorized into 2 groups: 1) patients with 
      confirmed dengue infection (n=843) and 2) patients with other febrile illnesses (n = 
      64). Both groups included patients with underlying hematologic-oncologic diseases 
      (55 vs 14) and without underlying disease (788 vs 50). Patients with underlying 
      diseases were divided into 3 subgroups by risk: Subgroup A, anemia risk, including 
      patients with thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies (n = 39) and G6PD deficiency (n=6); 
      Subgroup B, patients with bleeding risk, including hemophilia (n = 7), von 
      Willebrand disease (n = 1) and thrombocytopenia (n = 4); and Subgroup C, patients 
      with anemia and bleeding risk, including oncologic diseases (n =12). Acute hemolysis 
      in Subgroup A started during the febrile stage and required packed red cell 
      transfusions. Bleeding risk in Subgroup B started during the early febrile stage 
      with vasculopathy and continued to the late febrile stage with thrombocytopenia. 
      These patients required factor concentrate and platelet concentrate transfusions. 
      Anemia and bleeding risk in Subgroup C was greater among patients undergoing 
      chemotherapy than those who had discontinued treatment. The greater the length of 
      time since discontinuation of treatment, the lower risk. The case-fatality rate 
      among dengue infected patients with underlying disease (2/55 = 3.64%) was 
      significantly higher than those without underlying disease 0.63% (5/788).

AB  - The place of steroids in the management of severe forms of dengue is unclear. A 
      retrospective observational study showed the benefits of a single dose of 
      intravenous methyl prednisolone in a highly selected group of patients who developed 
      severe dengue during the febrile phase of infection. We report the case of a 
      14-year-old boy with dengue who developed three episodes of severe hemodynamic 
      compromise while having high fever, 'myocarditis', third space fluid accumulation, 
      progressive reduction in urine output, and altered mentation, who made a dramatic 
      recovery following a single dose of intravenous methyl prednisolone. Results justify 
      a well powered randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of this 
      treatment in severe dengue.

AB  - Dengue fever is one of the most neglected tropical diseases and of highest 
      international public health importance, with 50 million cases worldwide every year. 
      Early detection can decrease mortality rates from more than 20% to less than 1% and 
      the relevant early diagnosis analyte is the viral non-structural glycoprotein, NS1. 
      Currently, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the method of choice to 
      detect NS1. However, this is a time consuming method, requiring 3-5h, and it is the 
      bottleneck for routine of clinical analysis laboratory in epidemic periods, when 
      hundreds of samples should be tested. Here we describe an easy method combining 
      principles of fluorophore linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA) and enzyme linked 
      immunospotting (ELISPOT). For detection, we used mouse anti-NS1 IgG labeled with 
      fluorescent nanoparticles. The presented procedure needs only 4 μL of serum samples 
      and requires 45-60 min. The detection limit, 5.2 ng/mL, is comparable to ELISA 
      tests. The comparison of 83 samples with a commercial ELISA revealed a sensitivity 
      of 81% and specificity of 88%. The use of fluorescent nanoparticles provides a 
      higher sensitivity than an assay using usual fluorescent dye molecules, besides 
      avoiding bleaching effects. Based on the results, the proposed method provides fast, 
      specific and sensitive results, and proves to be a suitable method for Dengue NS1 
      detection in impoverished regions or epidemic areas.

TI  - N-acetylcysteine in children with dengue-associated liver failure: a case report.
PG  - 409-13
LID - 10.1093/tropej/fmr108 [doi]
AB  - There is no specific treatment for dengue-associated fulminant liver failure. We 
      report a child with dengue-associated fulminant liver failure who was treated 
      successfully with intravenous N-acetylcysteine. A 6-year-old boy was diagnosed with 
      dengue-associated fulminant liver failure. After administration of intravenous 
      N-acetylcysteine, a rapid decrease in liver transaminases and normalization of 
      coagulation profile was observed followed by clinical improvement and favourable 
      outcome despite factors associated with poor prognosis. The use of intravenous 
      N-acetylcysteine is safe and efficient in the treatment of dengue-associated 
      fulminant liver failure, especially in centres when liver transplantation is not 
      readily available.

LID - 10.1007/s00705-011-1178-6 [doi]
AB  - CD16 is a major molecule expressed on NK cells. To directly assess the role of 
      natural killer (NK) cells in dengue virus (DENV) infection in vivo, CD16 
      antibody-treated tamarins were inoculated with a DENV-2 strain. This resulted in the 
      transient depletion of CD16(+) NK cells, whereas no significant effects on the 
      overall levels or kinetics of plasma viral loads and antiviral antibodies were 
      observed in the treated monkeys when compared to control monkeys. It remains elusive 
      whether the CD16(-) NK subpopulation could play an important role in the control of 
      primary DENV infection.

TI  - Detection of dengue virus genome in urine by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR: a 
      laboratory diagnostic method useful after disappearance of the genome in serum.
PG  - 2047-52
LID - 10.1128/JCM.06557-11 [doi]
AB  - The reemergence of dengue virus (DENV) infection has created a requirement for 
      improved laboratory diagnostic procedures. In this study, DENV genome detection in 
      urine was evaluated as a diagnostic method. The DENV genome was detected by 
      real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in urine and serum of dengue patients. 
      The detection rate of DENV genome in urine was 25% (2/8) on disease days 0 to 3 and 
      32% (7/22) on days 4 to 5. The rate was 50% or higher on days 6 to 16, 52% (11/21) 
      on days 6 to 7, 78% (7/9) on days 8 to 9, 80% (4/5) on days 10 to 11, 50% (2/4) on 
      days 12 to 13, and 60% (3/5) on days 14 to 16. The last positive urine sample was on 
      day 16. The detection rates in serum were highest on days 0 to 3 and were greater 
      than 50% on days 0 to 7. Detection rates decreased thereafter, and the last positive 
      detection was on day 11. These results indicate that the time frames for positive 
      detection differ between urine and serum samples, whereby detection rates of 50% or 
      higher are evident between days 6 to 16 for urine samples and days 0 to 7 for serum 
      samples. Nucleotide sequences of PCR products were identical between urine and serum 
      samples. The detection of DENV genome in urine samples by real-time RT-PCR is useful 
      to confirm DENV infection, particularly after viremia disappears.

TI  - Dengue fever with unusual thalamic involvement.
PG  - 48-9
AB  - Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in the world and is caused 
      by four distinct viruses (type 1 to 4) that are closely related antigenically. 
      Infection by dengue virus may be asymptomatic or may lead to undifferentiated fever, 
      dengue fever or dengue haemorrhagic fever. Recent observations indicate that the 
      clinical profile of dengue is changing and the neurological complications are being 
      reported more frequently. The neurological features includeheadache, seizures, neck 
      stiffness, depressed sensorium, behavioural disorders, delirium, paralysis and 
      cranial nerve palsies. Such neurological symptoms in dengue fever wereattributed to 
      cerebral oedema, haemorrhage, haemoconcentration due to increasing vascular 
      permeability, coagulopathy and release of toxic substances. Cerebral oedema, 
      encephalitis-like changes (oedema and scattered focal lesions), intracranial 
      haemorrhages as well as selective involvement of bilateral hippocampus in dengue 
      infection have been reported previously on selective neuro-imaging but thalamic 
      involvement is rare. We here report a case of a typical presentation of 
      encephalopathy with left sided complete hemiplegia due to thalamic involvement in 
      dengue infection.

TI  - Testing the effectiveness of community-based dengue vector control interventions 
      using semiparametric mixed models.
PG  - 609-15

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results obtained though intersectoral coordination and 
      community empowerment in one study carried out during 6 years in Playa Municipality, 
      Cuba. METHODS: A longitudinal assessment comparing one intervention and one control 
      area was conducted. The intervention encompasses two main stages separated by two 
      dengue outbreaks. The first stage, focused on strengthening intersectoral 
      coordination, was initiated in January 2000. In August 2003, a complementary 
      strategy, focused on community empowerment and was initiated in half of the 
      intervention area. In the control area, routine dengue control activities continued 
      without additional input. We used entomologic surveillance data from January 1999 to 
      December 2005 to assess the effectiveness. We computed the Breteau index (BI) per 
      health area and the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the BIs at 
      each time point. A semiparametric mixed model to capture the evolution in time of 
      Aedes aegypti larval densities was fitted. RESULTS: The BI in the control area 
      showed the lowest value before starting the intervention. This was reversed 1 year 
      after launching intersectoral activities for dengue control in the intervention 
      area. In spite of spraying actions in all areas, the differences in BI between 
      intervention and control areas remain significant until December 2002. Although for 
      the next 2 years no differences were observed, they become significant again in 
      December 2004, which corresponds with the implementation of the complementary 
      community-based vector control strategy in the intervention area. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      model fitted identified monotonous trends over time and reversal trends at 
      particular moments. The confidence bands indicate sections with significant 
      differences between areas. Our data increase the evidence that the intersectoral 
      coordination and community empowerment strategy for A. aegypti control is effective.

TI  - Clinical spectrum of dengue fever in a tertiary care centre with particular 
      reference to atypical presentation in the 2012 outbreak in Kolkata.
PG  - 904-6
AB  - During the summer of 2012, dengue fever epidemic has emerged in Kolkata and spread 
      throughout West Bengal. During the epidemic period, wide spectrum of atypical 
      presentations of dengue fever has been observed. Here, in this study, the spectrum 
      of dengue fever was analysed in 300 patients who were found to have dengue serology 
      positive (NS1, IgM, IgG). The study was done in the department of medicine, RG Kar 
      Medical College, Kolkata. The patients were classified according to age, gender, 
      duration of symptoms on admission, associated comorbidities and coinfections, 
      complications that developed after admission, the final outcome and duration till 
      death after symptoms developed. The dengue fever cases started to appear from April 
      but it attained its peak during August-September this year. All ages were affected 
      but the brunt was borne maximally by those between 15 and 40 years. Females were 
      more affected than males. It may be concluded from the study that 30% had no 
      complications while 70% cases developed complications, 4% cases had underlying 
      comorbidities and coinfections, 68% developed thrombocytopenia and other 
      haemorrhagic features, 55% serositis, 25% acalculous cholecystitis, 20% myocarditis, 
      15% pancreatitis, 5% had central nervous system involvement, 0.66% rhabdomyolysis 
      and myositis, 0.33% secondary vasculitis and death occurred in 3% cases. More number 
      of patients were having multiple and atypical complications requiring 
      hospitalisation. Mortality was more common in patients with associated comorbidities 
      and coinfection. Awareness, early treatment with aggressive fluid replacement 
      therapy with close monitoring, supportive management andpatient education showed 
      promising results.

TI  - [Cultural dimensions of dengue that help or hinder its prevention in Mexico].
PG  - 197-203
LID - S1020-49892012000300003 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the cultural dimensions that might help or hinder dengue 
      prevention in two Mexican localities having different experiences related to this 
      disease. METHODS: A cognitive-cultural anthropological study was conducted involving 
      the participation of 160 adults selected through purposeful sampling. The techniques 
      of free lists and pile-sorting were used for investigating terms associated with the 
      concept "dengue." A consensus analysis was carried out by the factoring of principal 
      components, hierarchical cluster analysis, and multidimensional scaling. RESULTS: 
      Greater consensus was observed among participants from the population having more 
      historical experience with dengue-Santiago Ixcuintla, Nayarit-as well as more 
      structured cultural and complex dimensions than in Guadalajara. In the latter case, 
      participants showed a more fragmented conception of dengue, with insufficient 
      information on its symptoms, mechanisms of transmission, and vector reservoirs. 
      Three cultural dimensions were identified as hindering dengue prevention: confusing 
      and insufficient information, placing responsibility for prevention on other people 
      or on public agencies, and excessive confidence in fumigation as a preventive 
      measure. CONCLUSIONS: These obstacles will need to be taken into account in the 
      design and implementation of future prevention campaigns, disseminating information 
      that explains the risks of fumigation and the importance of citizens and authorities 
      jointly participating in the search for a comprehensive and sustainable solution to 
      the dengue problem.

TI  - Molecular evolution and epidemiology of four serotypes of dengue virus in Thailand 
      from 1973 to 2007.
PG  - 419-24

AB  - Thailand was a hyper-endemic country for dengue with co-circulation of four 
      serotypes and tens of thousands of infected cases annually. Taking into 
      consideration the large number of local dengue virus (DENV) sequences available in 
      GenBank, Thailand was the most ideal locality to study co-evolution of DENV. 
      Therefore, we undertook a large-scale molecular epidemiological analysis of all DENV 
      strains isolated in Thailand. In this study, we demonstrated that DENV strains of 
      four serotypes post-1990 grouped into distinct clades, and that specific mutations 
      in the envelope protein were first confirmed in these clades. Compared to the DENV1, 
      DENV2 and DENV3 clades, the DENV4 clade evolved markedly more slowly (6·4 × 10-5 
      substitutions/site per year). Our results also showed that the genetic diversity of 
      the predominant genotype of each serotype tended to slightly increase over time with 
      fluctuating changes, followed by a stationary phase after 2000. This suggests that 
      the four DENV clades became the predominant strains due to DENV possessing improved 
      fitness after long-term selection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the geographical distribution of dengue fever cases in 
      flooded areas of Villahermosa, Tabasco, in 2010. METHODS: Cross-sectional, 
      descriptive study. Universe: Colonies with antecedents of flooding during the 
      inundation of the State, located in Villahermosa, Tabasco: Gaviotas Norte, Gaviotas 
      Sur, La Manga 1th Section, La Manga 2nd Section and La Manga 3th Section. 
      Convenience sample without randomization. VARIABLES: location, dengue fever case. 
      ANALYSIS: descriptive statistic. Software: SPSS version 11.0. RESULTS: 540 
      individuals were included. The distribution was: Gaviotas Norte, 36.1%; Gaviotas 
      Sur, 24.8%; La Manga 1th Section, 13.8%; La Manga 2nd Section, 13.2%; and La Manga 
      3th Section, 12.1%. We found three cases with positive serology of IgG (0.6%) and 
      five cases of positive IgM (0.9%). The geographical distribution was associated with 
      the proximity to two water bodies: Rio Grijalva and Laguna El Encanto. CONCLUSIONS: 
      It is necessary to reinforce preventive interventions in the proximity of bodies of 
      fresh water.

AB  - Non-invasive specimens for dengue diagnosis may be preferable where venous blood is 
      difficult to collect and/or process, such as community-based or remote settings or 
      when sampling from young children. We evaluated the performance of oral swabs and 
      dried blood spots (DBS), compared with plasma, in diagnosing acute dengue and 
      screening for past dengue virus (DENV) exposure. DENV-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) 
      M, IgG, and NS1 antigen were detected both in oral swabs and DBS from acute 
      patients. Oral swabs were less sensitive (IgM: 68.7%, IgG: 91.9%, NS1: 64.7%), but 
      retained good specificity (100%, 92.3%, 95.8%, respectively) compared with plasma. 
      DBS displayed high sensitivity (IgM: 100%, IgG: 96%, NS1: 100%) and specificity 
      (IgM: 75%, IgG: 93%). DENV RNA was amplified from DBS (sensitivity 95.6%) but not 
      from oral swabs. DENV-IgG (indicative of past flavivirus exposure) were detected 
      with moderate sensitivity (61.1%) but poor specificity (50%) in oral swabs from 
      healthy volunteers. Dried blood spots allow sensitive and specific diagnosis of 
      acute dengue by serological, molecular, and antigen detection methods. Oral swabs 
      may be an adequate alternative where blood cannot be collected.

AB  - Secondary dengue viral infection can produce capillary leakage associated with 
      increased mortality known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Because the mortality 
      of DHF can be reduced by early detection and intensive support, improved methods for 
      its detection are needed. We applied multidimensional protein profiling to predict 
      outcomes in a prospective dengue surveillance study in South America. Plasma samples 
      taken from initial clinical presentation of acute dengue infection were subjected to 
      proteomics analyses using ELISA and a recently developed biofluid analysis platform. 
      Demographics, clinical laboratory measurements, nine cytokines, and 419 plasma 
      proteins collected at the time of initial presentation were compared between the DF 
      and DHF outcomes. Here, the subject's gender, clinical parameters, two cytokines, 
      and 42 proteins discriminated between the outcomes. These factors were reduced by 
      multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) that a highly accurate 
      classification model based on eight discriminant features with an area under the 
      receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.999. Model analysis indicated that the 
      feature-outcome relationship were nonlinear. Although this DHF risk model will need 
      validation in a larger cohort, we conclude that approaches to develop predictive 
      biomarker models for disease outcome will need to incorporate nonparametric modeling 
      approaches.

PG  - 5508-14

AB  - There are conflicting data on the relationship between the level of secreted NS1 
      (sNS1), viremia, and disease severity upon dengue virus (DENV) infection in the 
      clinical setting, and therefore, we examined this relationship in the widely 
      accepted AG129 mouse model. Because of the failure of a routinely used NS1 detection 
      kit to detect sNS1 of the mouse-adapted DENV2 strain, we screened 15 previously 
      undescribed NS1 monoclonal antibodies and developed a robust capture enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with detection sensitivity at the low nanogram level 
      (0.2 ng/ml) using recombinant baculovirus-expressed sNS1 as well as sNS1 that was 
      immunoaffinity purified from the various DENV2 strains employed in this study. Using 
      this test, we demonstrated that increased viremia paralleled severe pathologies; 
      however, sNS1 level did not correlate with viremia or severity. Furthermore, among 
      the DENV2 strains that were tested, the level of NS1 secretion did not correspond to 
      virus replication rate in vitro, at the cellular level. Together, our data indicate 
      that the magnitude of NS1 secretion appears to be strain dependent and does not 
      correlate with viral virulence in the AG129 mouse model.

TI  - Imbalance of angiopoietin-1 and angiopoetin-2 in severe dengue and relationship with 
      thrombocytopenia, endothelial activation, and vascular stability.
PG  - 943-6
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.12-0020 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of plasma leakage during dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock 
      syndrome (DHF/DSS) is largely unknown. Angiopoietins are key regulators of vascular 
      integrity: Angiopoietin-1 is stored in platelets and maintains vascular integrity, 
      and endothelium-derived angiopoietin-2 promotes vascular leakage. We determined 
      angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 levels in a cohort of children in Indonesia with 
      DHF/DSS and related them to plasma leakage markers. Patients with DHF/DSS had 
      reduced angiopoietin-1 and increased angiopoietin-2 plasma levels on the day of 
      admission when compared with levels at discharge and in healthy controls. There was 
      an inverse correlation between angiopoietin-1 and markers of plasma leakage and a 
      positive correlation between angiopoietin-2 and markers of plasma leakage. 
      Angiopoietin-1 levels followed the same trend as the soluble platelet activation 
      marker P-selectin and correlated with platelet counts. Dengue-associated 
      thrombocytopenia and endothelial activation are associated with an imbalance in 
      angiopoietin-2: angiopoietin-1 plasma levels. This imbalance may contribute to the 
      transient plasma leakage in DHF/DSS.

AB  - During the past three decades there has been a notable increase in dengue disease 
      severity in Venezuela. Nevertheless, the population structure of the viruses being 
      transmitted in this country is not well understood. Here, we present a molecular 
      epidemiological study on dengue viruses (DENV) circulating in Aragua State, 
      Venezuela during 2006-2007. Twenty-one DENV full-length genomes representing all of 
      the four serotypes were amplified and sequenced directly from the serum samples. 
      Notably, only DENV-2 was associated with severe disease. Phylogenetic trees 
      constructed using Bayesian methods indicated that only one genotype was circulating 
      for each serotype. However, extensive viral genetic diversity was found in DENV 
      isolated from the same area during the same period, indicating significant in situ 
      evolution since the introduction of these genotypes. Collectively, the results 
      suggest that the non-structural (NS) proteins may play an important role in DENV 
      evolution, particularly NS1, NS2A and NS4B proteins. The phylogenetic data provide 
      evidence to suggest that multiple introductions of DENV have occurred from the Latin 
      American region into Venezuela and vice versa. The implications of the significant 
      viral genetic diversity generated during hyperendemic transmission, particularly in 
      NS protein are discussed and considered in the context of future development and use 
      of human monoclonal antibodies as antivirals and tetravalent vaccines.

AB  - Dengue is the most important arboviral infection of humans. Thrombocytopenia is 
      frequently observed in the course of infection and haemorrhage may occur in severe 
      disease. The degree of thrombocytopenia correlates with the severity of infection, 
      and may contribute to the risk of haemorrhage. As a result of this prophylactic 
      platelet transfusions are sometimes advocated for the prevention of haemorrhage. 
      There is currently no evidence to support this practice, and platelet transfusions 
      are costly and sometimes harmful. We conducted a global survey to assess the 
      different approaches to the use of platelets in dengue. Respondents were all 
      physicians involved with the treatment of patients with dengue. Respondents were 
      asked that their answers reflected what they would do if they were the treating 
      physician. We received responses from 306 physicians from 20 different countries. 
      The heterogeneity of the responses highlights the variation in clinical practice and 
      lack of an evidence base in this area and underscores the importance of prospective 
      clinical trials to address this key question in the clinical management of patients 
      with dengue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on spatiotemporal clustering of human dengue virus (DENV) 
      infections, transmission is thought to occur at fine spatiotemporal scales by 
      horizontal transfer of virus between humans and mosquito vectors. To define the 
      dimensions of local transmission and quantify the factors that support it, we 
      examined relationships between infected humans and Aedes aegypti in Thai villages. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Geographic cluster investigations of 100-meter 
      radius were conducted around DENV-positive and DENV-negative febrile "index" cases 
      (positive and negative clusters, respectively) from a longitudinal cohort study in 
      rural Thailand. Child contacts and Ae. aegypti from cluster houses were assessed for 
      DENV infection. Spatiotemporal, demographic, and entomological parameters were 
      evaluated. In positive clusters, the DENV infection rate among child contacts was 
      35.3% in index houses, 29.9% in houses within 20 meters, and decreased with distance 
      from the index house to 6.2% in houses 80-100 meters away (p<0.001). Significantly 
      more Ae. aegypti were DENV-infectious (i.e., DENV-positive in head/thorax) in 
      positive clusters (23/1755; 1.3%) than negative clusters (1/1548; 0.1%). In positive 
      clusters, 8.2% of mosquitoes were DENV-infectious in index houses, 4.2% in other 
      houses with DENV-infected children, and 0.4% in houses without infected children 
      (p<0.001). The DENV infection rate in contacts was 47.4% in houses with infectious 
      mosquitoes, 28.7% in other houses in the same cluster, and 10.8% in positive 
      clusters without infectious mosquitoes (p<0.001). Ae. aegypti pupae and adult 
      females were more numerous only in houses containing infectious mosquitoes. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Human and mosquito infections are positively associated at 
      the level of individual houses and neighboring residences. Certain houses with high 
      transmission risk contribute disproportionately to DENV spread to neighboring 
      houses. Small groups of houses with elevated transmission risk are consistent with 
      over-dispersion of transmission (i.e., at a given point in time, people/mosquitoes 
      from a small portion of houses are responsible for the majority of transmission).

LID - e51335
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection with dengue viruses (DENV) causes a wide range of 
      manifestations from asymptomatic infection to a febrile illness called dengue fever 
      (DF), to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The in vivo targets of DENV and the 
      relation between the viral burden in these cells and disease severity are not known. 
      METHOD: The levels of positive and negative strand viral RNA in peripheral blood 
      monocytes, T/NK cells, and B cells and in plasma of DF and DHF cases were measured 
      by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Positive strand viral RNA was detected in 
      monocytes, T/NK cells and B cells with the highest amounts found in B cells. Viral 
      RNA levels in CD14+ cells and plasma were significantly higher in DHF compared to 
      DF, and in cases with a secondary infection compared to those undergoing a primary 
      infection. The distribution of viral RNA among cell subpopulations was similar in DF 
      and DHF cases. Small amounts of negative strand RNA were found in a few cases only. 
      The severity of plasma leakage correlated with viral RNA levels in plasma and in 
      CD14+ cells. CONCLUSIONS: B cells were the principal cells containing DENV RNA in 
      peripheral blood, but overall there was little active DENV RNA replication 
      detectable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Secondary infection and DHF 
      were associated with higher viral burden in PBMC populations, especially CD14+ 
      monocytes, suggesting that viral infection of these cells may be involved in disease 
      pathogenesis.

      dengue fever cases in Can Tho province, Vietnam.
PG  - 554-8
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.12-0101 [doi]
AB  - During 2006-2007, a cohort of 144 confirmed dengue cases in Can Tho Province, 
      Vietnam were compared with a matching set of 144 households that had no dengue 
      cases. Approximately 6-9 months after sickness, there were no significant 
      differences in terms of knowledge of the etiology of dengue, mosquito breeding 
      habitats, and prevention measures in respondents from both sets of households. There 
      was also no difference in the abundance of Aedes aegypti (Linn.) adults but the 
      average numbers of late instar and pupal Ae. aegypti per household were greater in 
      the negative control houses. Thus, the risk seemed to be no higher in case 
      households, although it is conceivable that changes may have occurred in either 
      group over the intervening period. The average cost for a dengue patient was 
      2,798,000 Vietnamese Dong (VND) (US$167.77), 2,154,000 VND for direct costs, and 
      644,000 VND for indirect costs. There was a 22% difference in cost for those with 
      and without health insurance. In terms of impact on family economies, 47.2% had to 
      borrow money for treatment, and after 6 months, 71.7% had not begun or had only 
      managed part repayments. Approximately 72.9% indicated that the cost of supporting a 
      dengue patient had impacted on the family economy, with the loss averaging 36% of 
      the annual income in the lowest economic quartile.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate lethal effect of culture filtrates of Streptomyces 
      citreofluorescens (S. citreofluorescens) against Anopheles stephensi (An. 
      stephensi), Culex quinquefasciatus (Cx. quinquefasciatus), and Aedes aegypti (Ae. 
      aegypti) larvae vectors for malaria, filarial and dengue. METHODS: The culture 
      filtrates obtained from S. citreofluorescens 2528 was grown in Potato Dextrose Broth 
      (PDB), filtrated and used for the bioassay after a growth of 15 days. RESULTS: The 
      results demonstrated that the An. stephensi shows mortalities with LC(50), LC(90) 
      values of first instar 46.8 μL/mL, 79.5 μL/mL, second instar 79.0 μL/mL, 95.6 μL/mL, 
      third instar 79.0 μL/mL, 136.9 μL/mL, and fourth instar 122.6 μL/mL, 174.5 μL/mL. 
      Whereas, The Cx. quinquefasciatus were found effective on first instar 40.0 μL/mL, 
      138.03 μL/mL, second instar 80.0 μL/mL, 181.97 μL/mL, third instar 100.0 μL/mL, 
      309.2 μL/mL, and fourth instar 60.0 μL/mL, 169.82 μL/mL. The Ae. aegypti were 
      successfully achieved susceptible with higher concentrations in comparisons of An. 
      stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae. These outcomes of the investigations have 
      compared with the Chitinase of Streptomyces griseus (S. griseus) C6137 that shows 
      90%-95% mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These new findings significantly permitted that the 
      culture filtrates of S. citreofluorescens can be used as bacterial larvicides. This 
      is an environmentally safe approach to control the vectors of malaria, dengue and 
      filariasis of tropical areas.

TI  - A community empowerment strategy embedded in a routine dengue vector control

PG  - 315-21
LID - 10.1016/j.trstmh.2012.01.013 [doi]
AB  - The non-sustainability of vertically organised dengue vector control programmes led 
      to pleas for changing the emphasis towards community-based strategies. We conducted 
      a cluster randomised controlled trial with 16 intervention and 16 control clusters 
      to test the effectiveness of a community empowerment strategy intertwined with the 
      routine dengue vector control programme in La Lisa, Havana City, Cuba. The 
      intervention included four components on top of routine control: organisation and 
      management; entomological risk surveillance; capacity building; and community work 
      for vector control. In the control clusters, routine activities continued without 
      interference. The community participation score increased from 1.4 to 3.4. Good 
      knowledge of breeding sites increased by 52.8% and 27.5% in the intervention and 
      control clusters, respectively. There were no changes in adequate Aedes aegypti 
      control practices at household level in the control clusters, but in the 
      intervention clusters adequacy increased by 36.2%. At baseline, the Breteau indices 
      (BI) were approximately 0.1 and were comparable; they fluctuated over time but 
      became different with the launch of the community-based dengue control activities in 
      the intervention clusters. Over the intervention period, the BI remained 53% (95% CI 
      22-92%) lower in these clusters than in the control clusters. The empowerment 
      strategy increased community involvement and added effectiveness to routine A. 
      aegypti control.

AB  - Depression of the peripheral blood platelet count during acute infection is a 
      hallmark of dengue. This thrombocytopenia has been attributed, in part, to an 
      insufficient level of platelet production by megakaryocytes that reside in the bone 
      marrow (BM). Interestingly, it was observed that dengue patients experience BM 
      suppression at the onset of fever. However, few studies focus on the interaction 
      between dengue virus (DENV) and megakaryocytes and how this interaction can lead to 
      a reduction in platelets. In the studies reported herein, BM cells from normal 
      healthy rhesus monkeys (RM) and humans were utilized to identify the cell lineage(s) 
      that were capable of supporting virus infection and replication. A number of 
      techniques were employed in efforts to address this issue. These included the use of 
      viral RNA quantification, nonstructural protein and infectivity assays, phenotypic 
      studies utilizing immunohistochemical staining, anti-differentiation DEAB treatment, 
      and electron microscopy. Cumulative results from these studies revealed that cells 
      in the BM were indeed highly permissive for DENV infection, with human BM having 
      higher levels of viral production compared to RM. DENV-like particles were 
      predominantly observed in multi-nucleated cells that expressed CD61+. These data 
      suggest that megakaryocytes are likely the predominant cell type infected by DENV in 
      BM, which provides one explanation for the thrombocytopenia and the dysfunctional 
      platelets characteristic of dengue virus infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is an endemic illness in the tropics with early and post 
      infectious complications affecting multiple systems. Though neurological sequelae 
      including mononeuropathy, encephalopathy, transverse myelitis, polyradiculopathy, 
      Guillain-Barre syndrome , optic neuropathy and oculomotor neuropathy have been 
      reported in medical literature, the abducens nerve despite its notoriety in cranial 
      neuropathies in a multitude of condition due to its long intracranial course had not 
      been to date reported to manifest with lateral rectus paralysis following dengue. 
      CASE PRESENTATION: A previously well 29 year old male with serologically confirmed 
      dengue hemorrhagic fever developed symptomatic right lateral rectus palsy during the 
      critical phase of the illness, which persisted into convalescence and post 
      convalescence with proven deficit on Hess screen. Alternate etiologies were excluded 
      by imaging, serology and electrophysiology. CONCLUSIONS: The authors detail the 
      first reported case of abducens nerve palsy complicating dengue fever in a 
      previously healthy male from Sri Lanka. In a tropical country with endemic dengue 
      infections, dengue related abducens neuropathy may be considered as a differential 
      diagnosis in cases of acquired lateral rectus palsy after dengue fever.

PG  - 289-96
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0684.2012.00552.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Marmosets are susceptible to dengue virus (DENV) infection. However, 
      blood parameter data and clinical signs of DENV-infected marmosets are limited. 
      METHODS: Blood hematological and serum biochemical values were obtained from twelve 
      DENV-inoculated and four mock-infected marmosets. Additionally, body temperature and 
      activity level were determined. RESULTS: Five DENV-inoculated marmosets demonstrated 
      thrombocytopenia, nine demonstrated leucopenia, and five demonstrated an increase in 
      the levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and BUN. Additionally, seven DENV-inoculated marmosets 
      demonstrated clinical signs including fever and decreases in activity. None of the 
      four mock-inoculated marmosets demonstrated changes in either hematological or 
      biochemical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Marmosets inoculated with DENV exhibited 
      clinical signs and changes in hematological and biochemical parameters. The results 
      suggest that blood parameter data and clinical signs could potentially be useful 
      markers for understanding the progress of DENV infection in studies using marmosets.

AB  - We describe sequences of six strains of dengue virus (DENV): three DENV-1 isolates 
      and two DENV-4 isolates from Puerto Rico, and a DENV-1 strain from Key West, 
      Florida, obtained from blood donors during 2010 epidemics. Phylogenetic analysis 
      revealed that the Puerto Rico DENV-1 strains constitute a new lineage within 
      genotype V different from those that circulated in Puerto Rico during the past two 
      decades. The newer Puerto Rico DENV-1 strains associated with strains from the 
      Caribbean and South America. The DENV-1 strain from Key West, Florida clustered with 
      a strain isolated from mosquito pools collected in that area and with a number of 
      strains from Nicaragua and Mexico circulating during 2006-2009. The Puerto Rico 
      DENV-4 isolates of genotype II associated with strains that have circulated on the 
      island throughout the 1980s and 1990s and with strains from the Caribbean region and 
      Central America. Introduction and circulation of novel DENV lineages in 
      dengue-endemic regions have the potential to increase the severity of dengue cases.

TI  - Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) receptor restricts systemic dengue virus replication and 
      prevents paralysis in IFN-α/β receptor-deficient mice.
PG  - 12561-70
LID - 10.1128/JVI.06743-11 [doi]
AB  - We previously reported that mice lacking alpha/beta and gamma interferon receptors 
      (IFN-α/βR and -γR) uniformly exhibit paralysis following infection with the dengue 
      virus (DENV) clinical isolate PL046, while only a subset of mice lacking the IFN-γR 
      alone and virtually no mice lacking the IFN-α/βR alone develop paralysis. Here, 
      using a mouse-passaged variant of PL046, strain S221, we show that in the absence of 
      the IFN-α/βR, signaling through the IFN-γR confers approximately 140-fold greater 
      resistance against systemic vascular leakage-associated dengue disease and virtually 
      complete protection from dengue-induced paralysis. Viral replication in the spleen 
      was assessed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, which revealed a reduction 
      in the number of infected cells due to IFN-γR signaling by 2 days after infection, 
      coincident with elevated levels of IFN-γ in the spleen and serum. By 4 days after 
      infection, IFN-γR signaling was found to restrict DENV replication systemically. 
      Clearance of DENV, on the other hand, occurred in the absence of IFN-γR, except in 
      the central nervous system (CNS) (brain and spinal cord), where clearance relied on 
      IFN-γ from CD8(+) T cells. These results demonstrate the roles of IFN-γR signaling 
      in protection from initial systemic and subsequent CNS disease following DENV 
      infection and demonstrate the importance of CD8(+) T cells in preventing 
      DENV-induced CNS disease.

TI  - Spatial distribution of dengue in the city of Cruzeiro, São Paulo State, Brazil: use 
      of geoprocessing tools.
PG  - 261-6
LID - S0036-46652012000500005 [pii]
AB  - The aim of this article is to identify patterns in spatial distribution of cases of 
      dengue fever that occurred in the municipality of Cruzeiro, State of São Paulo, in 
      2006. This is an ecological and exploratory study using the tools of spatial 
      analysis in the preparation of thematic maps with data from Sinan-Net. An analysis 
      was made by area, taking as unit the IBGE census, the analysis included four months 
      in 2006 which show the occurrence of the disease in the city. The thematic maps were 
      constructed by TerraView 3.3.1 software, the same software provided the values of 
      the indicators of Global Moran (I M) every month and the Kernel estimation. In the 
      year 2006, 691 cases of dengue were georeferenced (with a rate of 864.2 
      cases/100,000 inhabitants); the indicators of Moran and p-values obtained were I M = 
      0.080 (March) p = 0.11; I M = 0.285 (April) p = 0.01; I M = 0.201 (May) p = 0.01 and 
      I M = 0.002 (June) p = 0.57. The first cases were identified in the Northeast and 
      Central areas of Cruzeiro and the recent cases, in the North, Northeast and Central. 
      It was possible to identify census tracts where the epidemic began and how it 
      occurred temporally and spatially in the city.

TI  - Evaluation of the WHO revised criteria for classification of clinical disease 
      severity in acute adult dengue infection.
PG  - 645
LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-5-645 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The WHO guidelines were revised recently to identify patients with 
      severe dengue (SD) early. We proceeded to determine the usefulness of the warning 
      signs in the new WHO guidelines in predicting SD and we have also attempted to 
      define other simple laboratory parameters that could be useful in predicting SD. 
      METHODS: Clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded in 184 patients in 2011, 
      with confirmed dengue viral infections, admitted to a medical ward in two tertiary 
      care hospitals in Colombo, Sri Lanka. RESULTS: We found that the presence of 5 or 
      more dengue warning signs were significantly (p=0.02) associated with the 
      development of SD (odds ratio 5.14, 95% CI=1.312 to 20.16). The AST levels were 
      significantly higher (p=0.0001) in patients with abdominal pain (mean 243.5, SD ± 
      200.7), when compared to those who did not have abdominal pain (mean 148.5, SD ± 
      218.6). Lymphocyte counts <1,500 cells/mm(3) were significantly (p=0.005) associated 
      with SD (odds ratio 3.367, 95% CI 1.396 to 8.123). High AST levels were also 
      significantly associated (p<0.0001) with SD (odds ratio 27.26, 95% CI 1.632 to 
      455.2). Platelet counts <20,000 cells/mm(3), were again significantly associated 
      (p<0.001) with severe disease (odds ratio 1.632 to 455.2, 95% CI 3.089 to 14.71). 
      The PCR was positive in 26/84 of the patients and we found that the infecting 
      serotype was DEN-1 in all 26 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of 5 or more 
      warning signs appears to be a predictor of SD. Lymphocyte counts <1,500 cells/mm(3), 
      platelet counts <20,000/mm(3) and raised AST levels were associated with SD and 
      could be used to help identify patients who are likely to develop SD.

PG  - e1957
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001957 [doi]
LID - e1957
AB  - BACKGROUND: Determining the factors underlying the long-range spatial spread of 
      infectious diseases is a key issue regarding their control. Dengue is the most 
      important arboviral disease worldwide and a major public health problem in tropical 
      areas. However the determinants shaping its dynamics at a national scale remain 
      poorly understood. Here we describe the spatial-temporal pattern of propagation of 
      annual epidemics in Cambodia and discuss the role that human movements play in the 
      observed pattern. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used wavelet phase analysis to analyse 
      time-series data of 105,598 hospitalized cases reported between 2002 and 2008 in the 
      135 (/180) most populous districts in Cambodia. We reveal spatial heterogeneity in 
      the propagation of the annual epidemic. Each year, epidemics are highly synchronous 
      over a large geographic area along the busiest national road of the country whereas 
      travelling waves emanate from a few rural areas and move slowly along the Mekong 
      River at a speed of ~11 km per week (95% confidence interval 3-18 km per week) 
      towards the capital, Phnom Penh. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest human movements - using 
      roads as a surrogate - play a major role in the spread of dengue fever at a national 
      scale. These findings constitute a new starting point in the understanding of the 
      processes driving dengue spread.

LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.12-0335 [doi]
AB  - We did a prospective study in southern Vietnam where new water infrastructure was 
      added. New 1,200-L tanks may present potential breeding grounds for Aedes aegypti, 
      particularly when sealed lids were not always supplied. Some householders in these 
      communes received a piped water supply, however there was no reduction in water 
      storage practices. The prevalence of Aedes aegypti immatures in tank and tap 
      households reached 73%, but were non-significantly different from each other and 
      from control households that received no infrastructure. In all three communes, 
      standard jars comprised from 48% to 71% of containers but were associated with > 90% 
      of III-IV instars and pupae on occasions. In contrast, project tanks contributed 
      from 0-21% of the total population. Non-functional or no lids were apparent 4 months 
      after installation in 45-76% of new tanks, but there was no difference between 
      communes with lids and without lids.

TI  - Severe perinatal dengue hemorrhagic fever in a low birth weight infant.
PG  - 62-7
AB  - A 31-year-old Hmong (Thai hilltribe) multiparous (G5P2) female with dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever delivered a low birth weight male infant at 34 weeks estimated 
      gestational age. The mother had fever for a total of 6 days, along with 
      hepatomegaly, hepatic dysfunction and thrombocytopenia. Serology showed acute 
      secondary dengue infection. She had no serious complications. The infant (birth 
      weight 1,850 grams) developed a fever 140 hours postpartum of 37.8 degrees C for one 
      day, then developed drowsiness, poor feeding and apnea. Hepatomegaly, 
      thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction and moderate coagulopathy were detected, with 
      consequential shock and anemia due to gastrointestinal and pulmonary hemorrhage. 
      Vigorous treatment with mechanical ventilation, packed red cells (PRC), fresh frozen 
      plasma (FFP) and platelet concentrate transfusions were given and the child 
      recovered successfully and commenced breast-feeding. At six months of age the 
      child's growth and development were normal except for an impaired hearing screening 
      test.

TI  - The 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 reduces dengue virus infection in human myelomonocyte 
      (U937) and hepatic (Huh-7) cell lines and cytokine production in the infected 
      monocytes.

AB  - Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral infection in humans. Recent 
      evidence suggests that vitamin D influences virus replication. In this work, the 
      effect of vitamin D treatment on dengue virus infection in human hepatic Huh-7 cells 
      and on virus infection and cytokine production in the human monocytic U937 cells was 
      evaluated. Exposure to 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, resulted in a significant 
      reduction in the number of infected cells, in conditions where cell viability was 
      not affected. Viral replication in monocytic cells was more susceptible to vitamin 
      D3 than replication in the hepatic cells. Moreover, vitamin D3 significantly reduced 
      the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-1β) produced 
      by infected U937 cells. These results suggest that vitamin D3 may represent a 
      potentially useful antiviral compound.

AB  - This study examined the impact of road networks on the distribution of dengue fever 
      cases in Trinidad, West Indies. All confirmed cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever 
      (DHF) observed during 1998 were georeferenced and spatially located on a road map of 
      Trinidad using Geographic Information Systems software. A new digital geographic 
      layer representing these cases was created and the distances from these cases to the 
      nearest classified road category (5 classifications based on a functional utility 
      system) were examined. The distance from each spatially located DHF case to the 
      nearest road in each of the 5 road subsets was determined and then subjected to an 
      ANOVA and t-test to determine levels of association between minor road networks 
      (especially 3rd and 4th class roads) and DHF cases and found DHF cases were located 
      away from forests, especially 5th class roads). The frequency of DHF cases to 
      different road classes was: 0% (1st class roads), 7% (2nd class roads), 32% (3rd 
      class roads), 57% (4th class roads) and 4% (5th class road). The data clearly 
      demonstrated that both class 3 and class 4 roads account for 89% of nearby dengue 
      cases. These results represent the first evidence of dengue cases being found 
      restricted between forested areas and major highways and would be useful when 
      planning and implementing control strategies for dengue and Aedes aegypti 
      mosquitoes.

TI  - Complete genome sequencing and evolutionary analysis of dengue virus serotype 1 
      isolates from an outbreak in Kerala, South India.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1007/s11262-012-0756-3 [doi]
AB  - In this study, dengue virus (DENV) isolates from a localized, small-scale, 
      non-seasonal dengue outbreak were genetically characterized. The outbreak occurred 
      during the pre-monsoon months (April-May) in a medical college campus in Kerala, 
      South India in 2009 affecting 76 people. Analysis of 39 viral RNA positive serum 
      samples by a serotype specific reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction 
      identified dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV1) as the causative strain. Formation of a 
      distinct genetic clade was revealed in the initial phylogenetic analysis using 
      nucleotide sequences of a partial (303 bp) Capsid-Pre-membrane protein (C-PrM) 
      coding region of 37 outbreak strains. The sequences of these strains clustered with 
      that of the Genotype III DENV-1 strains from India, and 32 among them formed a 
      single major sub-clade. Whole-genome sequencing (10,693 bp) of two strains 
      (RGCB585/2009 and RGCB592/2009) selected from this major sub-clade, and subsequent 
      phylogenetic analysis using the full-length coding region sequence showed that the 
      sequences grouped with that of the isolates from Thailand (1980), Comoros (1993), 
      Singapore (1993), and Brunei (2005) among the Indo-Pacific isolates. The sequences 
      of the two strains had a nucleotide identity of 97-98 % and an amino acid identity 
      of 98-99 % with these closely related strains. Maximum amino acid similarity was 
      shown with the Singapore 8114/93 isolate (99.6 %). Four mutations-L46M in the 
      capsid, D278N in the NS1, L123I, and L879S in the NS5 protein coding regions-were 
      seen as signature substitutions uniformly in RGCB585/2009 and RGCB592/2009; in 
      another isolate from Kerala (RGCB419/2008) and in the Brunei isolate (DS06-210505). 
      These four isolates also had in common a 21-nucleotide deletion in the 
      hyper-variable region of the 3'-non-translated region. This first report on the 
      complete genome characterization of DENV-1 isolates from India reveals a dengue 
      outbreak caused by a genetically different viral strain. The results point to the 
      possibility of exotic introduction of these circulating viral strains in the region.

AB  - The usefulness of detecting circulating non-structural protein 1 (NS1) IgM 
      antibodies for diagnosing acute dengue virus infection was evaluated during an 
      outbreak investigation along with other routinely used laboratory diagnostic 
      methods. For the first time, the samples were also tested for NS1 antigen detection. 
      NS1 IgM antibody detects all the serum samples that were positive for NS1 antigen 
      detection within first 5 days of infection. The sensitivity of the NS1 IgM ELISA was 
      higher when compared with RT-PCR and therefore, it could be used for early 
      diagnosis.

AB  - A 26-year-old nurse presented with a three-day history of sudden onset of pyrexia of 
      39 °C, malaise, and a patchy maculopapular rash, after returning from a monthlong 
      work in Senegal. A tourniquet was applied to help locate the vein for diagnostic 
      blood sampling. After the procedure, a petechial rash erupted with a demarcation 
      line below the level of the tourniquet. A diagnostic test for dengue fever was 
      performed and confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to be positive for 
      serotype DEN-1. The tourniquet test is performed by inflating a blood pressure cuff 
      tied on the upper arm to a point midway between systolic and diastolic blood 
      pressure for five minutes. The test is considered positive when there are 20 or more 
      petechiae per square inch (6.25 cm(2)) on the forearm, and is one of several 
      clinical parameters considered by the World Health Organization to be important in 
      the diagnosis of dengue fever.

AB  - Little is known about the role of chemokines/chemokines receptors on T cells in 
      natural DENV infection. Patients from DENV-2 and -3- outbreaks were studied 
      prospectively during the acute or convalescent phases. Expression of chemokine 
      receptor and activation markers on lymphocyte subpopulations were determined by flow 
      cytometry analysis, plasma chemokine ligands concentrations were measured by ELISA 
      and quantification of CCL5/RANTES(+) cells in liver tissues from fatal dengue cases 
      was performed by immunochemistry. In the acute DENV-infection, T-helper/T-cytotoxic 
      type-1 cell (Th1/Tc1)-related CCR5 is significantly higher expressed on both CD4 and 
      CD8 T cells. The Th1-related CXCR3 is up-regulated among CD4 T cells and Tc2-related 
      CCR4 is up-regulated among CD8 T cells. In the convalescent phase, all chemokine 
      receptor or chemokine ligand expression tends to reestablish control healthy levels. 
      Increased CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL4/MIP-1β but decreased CCL5/RANTES levels were observed 
      in DENV-patients during acute infection. Moreover, we showed an increased CD107a 
      expression on CCR5 or CXCR3-expressing T cells and higher expression of CD29, 
      CD44(HIGH) and CD127(LOW) markers on CCR4-expressing CD8 T cells in DENV-patients 
      when compared to controls. Finally, liver from dengue fatal patients showed 
      increased number of cells expressing CCL5/RANTES in three out of four cases compared 
      to three death from a non-dengue patient. In conclusion, both Th1-related CCR5 and 
      CXCR3 among CD4 T cells have a potential ability to exert cytotoxicity function. 
      Moreover, Tc1-related CCR5 and Tc2-related CCR4 among CD8 T cells have a potential 
      ability to exert effector function and migration based on cell markers evaluated. 
      The CCR5 expression would be promoting an enhanced T cell recruitment into liver, a 
      hypothesis that is corroborated by the CCL5/RANTES increase detected in hepatic 
      tissue from dengue fatal cases. The balance between protective and pathogenic immune 
      response mediated by chemokines during dengue fever will be discussed.

TI  - Acute kidney injury in dengue fever using Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria: 
      incidence and risk factors.
PG  - 160-2
LID - 10.1258/td.2012.120023 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess incidence and risk factors for acute kidney 
      injury (AKI) in patients with dengue fever (DF). A total of 223 patients (males, 
      130; females, 93; mean age, 26.2 ± 18.2 years) from a tertiary care centre in 
      southern India were retrospectively analysed. Acute renal failure (ARF) developed in 
      24 (10.8%) patients. Based on the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria, the 
      results revealed that: 12 (5.4%) had mild AKI; seven (3.1%) had moderate AKI; and 
      five (2.2%) had severe AKI. A further 54 (24%) were diagnosed with dengue 
      haemorrhagic fever (DHF); 11 (5%) were co-infected with leptospirosis; 
      thrombocytopenia was present in 157 (70%); and 64 (29%) were hypotensive. Patients 
      were divided into either group A (with AKI) or group B (without AKI), and group A 
      was divided into mild (A1), moderate (A2) and severe (A3) subgroups. We recorded: a 
      higher total white count (A = 9824; B = 6706; P = 0.01); serum glutamic pyruvic 
      transaminase (SGPT; A = 450; B = 144; P = 0.001); alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels 
      (A = 207; B = 42; P = 0.001); lower albumin (A = 2.65; B = 3.09; P < 0.001); and 
      serum bicarbonate (A = 20.57; B = 23.21; P = 0.009). Hypotension (P = 0.01), 
      coexisting viral hepatitis (P < 0.001), sepsis (P < 0.001), multiple organ 
      dysfunction syndrome (MODS; P < 0.001) and the need for inotropes (P < 0.001) were 
      associated with DF. Total white count (P = 0.038), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
      on discharge (P = 0.034), specific gravity of urine (P = 0.006), ALP (P = 0.013), 
      SGPT (P = 0.042), MODS (P = 0.05) and use of platelet fresh frozen plasma (FFP; P = 
      0.007) were significantly different between mild, moderate and severe AKI subgroups. 
      Twenty-two (9%) died. AKI is associated with an increased mortality in DF (P = 
      0.005).

TI  - Eliciting cross-neutralizing antibodies in mice challenged with a dengue virus 
      envelope domain III expressed in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 369-80
LID - 10.1139/w11-137 [doi]
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENVs) are mosquito-borne infectious pathogens that pose a serious 
      global public health threat, and at present, no therapy or effective vaccines are 
      available. Choosing suitable units as candidates is fundamental for the development 
      of a dengue subunit vaccine. Domain III of the DENV-2 E protein (EDIII) was chosen 
      in the present study and expressed in Escherichia coli by N-terminal fusion to a 
      bacterial leader (pelB), and C-terminal fusion with a 6×His tag based on the 
      functions of DENV structure proteins, especially the neutralizing epitopes on the 
      envelope E protein. After two-step purification using Ni-NTA affinity and 
      cation-exchange chromatography, the His-tagged EDIII was purified up to 98% 
      homogenicity. This recombinant EDIII was able to trigger high levels of neutralizing 
      antibodies in both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Both the recombinant EDIII and its 
      murine antibodies protected Vero cells from DENV-2 infection. Interestingly, the 
      recombinant EDIII provides at least partial cross-protection against DENV-1 
      infection. In addition, the EDIII antibodies were able to protect suckling mice from 
      virus challenge in vivo. These data suggest that a candidate molecule based on the 
      small EDIII protein, which has neutralizing epitopes conserved among all 4 DENV 
      serotypes, has important implications.

TI  - Nonstructural protein NS1 immunodominant epitope detected specifically in dengue 
      virus infected material by a SELDI-TOF/MS based assay.
PG  - 490-9
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23204 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) infection is the most common mosquito-born viral disease of public 
      health significance. Though most patients only suffer from flu-like symptoms, a 
      small group of patients experiences more severe forms of the disease. The viral 
      nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), a secreted protein correlating with viremia, is a key 
      element used for dengue diagnosis with potential implications in severe dengue 
      prognosis. Capture-ELISAs for the early detection of the NS1 protein in the sera 
      during the acute febrile stage are commonly used in routine by diagnostic 
      laboratories. In this study, the detection of NS1 protein in DV-infected material 
      was assessed by an alternative method combining a single NS1-directed monoclonal 
      antibody and the SELDI-TOF/MS technology. According to the epitope mapping, the 
      antibodies used are mainly directed against an immuno-dominant peptide located on 
      the C-terminal part of the protein. The NS1 SELDI-TOF assay is specific, has a 
      sensitivity level close to capture-ELISAs and is potentially useful for a coupled 
      serotyping/detection assay or for the detection of subtle post-translational 
      modifications on the protein.

TI  - Assessing the risk for dengue fever based on socioeconomic and environmental 
      variables in a geographical information system environment.
PG  - 171-6
AB  - An important option in preventing the spread of dengue fever (DF) is to control and 
      monitor its vector (Aedes aegypti) as well as to locate and destroy suitable 
      mosquito breeding environments. The aim of the present study was to use a 
      combination of environmental and socioeconomic variables to model areas at risk of 
      DF. These variables include clinically confirmed DF cases, mosquito counts, 
      population density in inhabited areas, total populations per district, water access, 
      neighbourhood quality and the spatio-temporal risk of DF based on the average, 
      weekly frequency of DF incidence. Out of 111 districts investigated, 17 (15%), 
      covering a total area of 121 km2, were identified as of high risk, 25 (22%), 
      covering 133 km2, were identified as of medium risk, 18 (16%), covering 180 km2, 
      were identified as of low risk and 51 (46%), covering 726 km2, were identified as of 
      very low risk. The resultant model shows that most areas at risk of DF were 
      concentrated in the central part of Jeddah county, Saudi Arabia. The methods used 
      can be implemented as routine procedures for control and prevention. A concerted 
      intervention in the medium- and high-risk level districts identified in this study 
      could be highly effective in reducing transmission of DF in the area as a whole.

AB  - DENV1-E106 is a monoclonal antibody (MAb) with strong neutralizing activity against 
      all five DENV-1 genotypes and therapeutic activity in mice. Here, we evaluated the 
      potential for DENV-1 to escape neutralization by DENV1-E106. A single mutation in 
      domain III of the envelope protein (T329A) emerged, which conferred resistance to 
      DENV1-E106. However, the T329A variant virus had differing phenotypes in vitro and 
      in vivo with attenuation in cell culture yet increased infectivity in Aedes aegypti 
      mosquitoes. Mice infected with this T329A variant still were protected against 
      lethal infection by DENV1-E106 even though much of the neutralizing activity was 
      lost. This study reveals the complex dynamics of neutralization escape of an 
      inhibitory MAb against DENV, and suggests that evaluation of therapeutic MAbs 
      requires detailed investigation in relevant hosts.

AB  - Dengue is emerging as the most important mosquito borne viral disease in the world. 
      In mainland China, sporadic and large outbreaks of dengue illness caused by the four 
      serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to DENV-4) have been well documented. Guangdong 
      province is the major affected area in China, and DENV-1 has dominantly circulated 
      in Guangdong for a long time. In this study, a family cluster of DENV-3 infection in 
      Guangzhou was described. Three cases were diagnosed as dengue fever based on 
      clinical manifestation, serological and RT-PCR assays. Two DENV-3 strains were 
      isolated in C6/36 cells and the complete genome sequences were determined. 
      Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the new DENV-3 isolates from the family cluster 
      were grouped within genotype III. Considering the fact that several DENV-3 strains 
      within genotype V were also identified in Guangzhou in 2009, at least two genotypes 
      of DENV-3 co-circulated in Guangzhou. Careful investigation and virological analysis 
      should be warranted in the future.

AB  - Diagnosis of dengue virus (DENV) infection in fatal cases is challenging because of 
      the frequent unavailability of blood or fresh tissues. For formalin-fixed, 
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues immunohistochemistry (IHC) can be used; however, it 
      may not be as sensitive and serotyping is not possible. The application of reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of DENV in FFPE 
      tissues has been very limited. We evaluated FFPE autopsy tissues of 122 patients 
      with suspected DENV infection by flavivirus and DENV RT-PCR, sequencing, and DENV 
      IHC. The DENV was detected in 61 (50%) cases by RT-PCR or IHC. The RT-PCR and 
      sequencing detected DENV in 60 (49%) cases (DENV-1 in 16, DENV-2 in 27, DENV-3 in 8, 
      and DENV-4 in 6 cases). No serotype could be identified in three cases. The IHC 
      detected DENV antigens in 50 (40%) cases. The RT-PCR using FFPE tissue improves 
      detection of DENV in fatal cases and provides sequence information useful for typing 
      and epidemiologic studies.

TI  - The first dominant co-circulation of both dengue and chikungunya viruses during the 
      post-monsoon period of 2010 in Delhi, India.
PG  - 1337-42
LID - 10.1017/S0950268811001671 [doi]
AB  - Independent outbreaks of dengue virus (DENV) infection and sporadic cases of 
      chikungunya virus (CHIKV) have been recorded in the metropolitan city of Delhi on 
      several occasions in the past. However, during a recent 2010 arboviral outbreak in 
      Delhi many cases turned negative for DENV. This prompted us to use duplex reverse 
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (D-RT-PCR) to establish the aetiology of 
      dengue/chikungunya through sequencing of CprM and E1 genes of dengue and chikungunya 
      viruses. Interestingly, for the first time, both DENV and CHIKV co-circulated 
      simultaneously and in equally dominant proportion during the post-monsoon period of 
      2010. DENV-1 genotype III and the East Central South African genotype of CHIKV were 
      associated with post-monsoon spread of these viruses.

      derivatives for the treatment of dengue virus infection.
PG  - 6061-75
LID - 10.1021/jm300171v [doi]
AB  - We recently described the discovery of oxygenated N-alkyl deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) 
      derivative 7 (CM-10-18) with antiviral activity against dengue virus (DENV) 
      infection both in vitro and in vivo. This imino sugar was promising but had an 
      EC(50) against DENV in BHK cells of 6.5 μM, which limited its use in in vivo. 
      Compound 7 presented structural opportunities for activity relationship analysis, 
      which we exploited and report here. These structure-activity relationship studies 
      led to analogues 2h, 2l, 3j, 3l, 3v, and 4b-4c with nanomolar antiviral activity 
      (EC(50) = 0.3-0.5 μM) against DENV infection, while maintaining low cytotoxicity 
      (CC(50) > 500 μM, SI > 1000). In male Sprague-Dawley rats, compound 3l was well 
      tolerated at a dose up to 200 mg/kg and displayed desirable PK profiles, with 
      significantly improved bioavailability (F = 92 ± 4%).

      descriptive case studies from the Philippines.
PG  - 269
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-269 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Analysis is lacking on the management of vector control systems in 
      disease-endemic countries with respect to the efficiency and sustainability of 
      operations. METHODS: Three locations were selected, at the scale of province, 
      municipality and barangay (i.e. village). Data on disease incidence, programme 
      activities, and programme management were collected on-site through meetings and 
      focus group discussions. RESULTS: Adaptation of disease control strategies to the 
      epidemiological situation per barangay, through micro-stratification, brings gains 
      in efficiency, but should be accompanied by further capacity building on local 
      situational analysis for better selection and targeting of vector control 
      interventions within the barangay. An integrated approach to vector control, aiming 
      to improve the rational use of resources, was evident with a multi-disease strategy 
      for detection and response, and by the use of combinations of vector control 
      methods. Collaboration within the health sector was apparent from the involvement of 
      barangay health workers, re-orientation of job descriptions and the creation of a 
      disease surveillance unit. The engagement of barangay leaders and use of existing 
      community structures helped mobilize local resources and voluntary services for 
      vector control. In one location, local authorities and the community were involved 
      in the planning, implementation and evaluation of malaria control, which triggered 
      local programme ownership. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies that contributed to an improved 
      efficiency and sustainability of vector control operations were: 
      micro-stratification, integration of vector control within the health sector, a 
      multi-disease approach, involvement of local authorities, and empowerment of 
      communities. Capacity building on situational analysis and vector surveillance 
      should be addressed through national policy and guidelines.

TI  - Natural transovarial dengue virus infection rate in both sexes of dark and pale 
      forms of Aedes aegypti from an urban area of Bangkok, Thailand.
PG  - 1146-52
AB  - Transovarial dengue virus infection status of two forms of adult Aedes aegypti (dark 
      or Ae. aegypti type form and pale or form queenslandensis), reared from 
      field-collected larval and pupal stages, was determined by one-step RT-PCR and 
      dengue viral serotype by nested-PCR. Natural transovarial transmission (TOT) of 
      dengue virus was detected in the two Ae. aegypti forms, and in both adult males and 
      females. Male Ae. aegypti had a higher rate of TOT dengue virus infection than 
      female. The overall minimum infection rate among the male and female populations was 
      19.5 and 12.3 per 1,000 mosquitoes, respectively. All four dengue serotypes were 
      detected in mosquito samples, with DEN-4 being the predominant serotype. Thus, both 
      male and female Ae. aegypti have influences on the epidemiology of dengue virus 
      transmission.

AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses 
      transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. There are four genetically distinct serotypes 
      designated DENV-1 through DENV-4, each further subdivided into distinct genotypes. 
      The dengue scientific community has long contended that infection with one serotype 
      confers lifelong protection against subsequent infection with the same serotype, 
      irrespective of virus genotype. However this hypothesis is under increased scrutiny 
      and the role of DENV genotypic variation in protection from repeated infection is 
      less certain. As dengue vaccine trials move increasingly into field-testing, there 
      is an urgent need to develop tools to better define the role of genotypic variation 
      in DENV infection and immunity. To better understand genotypic variation in DENV-3 
      neutralization and protection, we designed and constructed a panel of isogenic, 
      recombinant DENV-3 infectious clones, each expressing an envelope glycoprotein from 
      a different DENV-3 genotype; Philippines 1982 (genotype I), Thailand 1995 (genotype 
      II), Sri Lanka 1989 and Cuba 2002 (genotype III) and Puerto Rico 1977 (genotype IV). 
      We used the panel to explore how natural envelope variation influences 
      DENV-polyclonal serum interactions. When the recombinant viruses were tested in 
      neutralization assays using immune sera from primary DENV infections, neutralization 
      titers varied by as much as ∼19-fold, depending on the expressed envelope 
      glycoprotein. The observed variability in neutralization titers suggests that 
      relatively few residue changes in the E glycoprotein may have significant effects on 
      DENV specific humoral immunity and influence antibody mediated protection or disease 
      enhancement in the setting of both natural infection and vaccination. These 
      genotypic differences are also likely to be important in temporal and spatial 
      microevolution of DENV-3 in the background of heterotypic neutralization. The 
      recombinant and synthetic tools described here are valuable for testing hypotheses 
      on genetic determinants of DENV-3 immunopathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti is the primary mosquito vector for dengue virus (DENV) 
      worldwide. Infectivity of dengue virus varies among natural populations of this 
      mosquito. How A. aegypti responds to DENV infection relative to which genes and 
      associated pathways contribute to its differential susceptibility as a vector is not 
      well defined. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we used custom cDNA microarrays to 
      identify groups of genes that were differentially expressed in midgut tissues 
      between susceptible and refractory strains in a highly time specific manner. While 
      genes involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, mRNA 
      surveillance, and the proteasome were significantly up-regulated in the susceptible 
      strain, several metabolic processes including glycolysis, glycan biosynthesis and 
      Wnt pathway were active in the refractory strain. In addition, several key signaling 
      genes were expressed as common responsive genes in both susceptible and refractory 
      mosquitoes that may be necessary for signal transduction to trigger the appropriate 
      host response to the viral infection. These are coordinately expressed in the form 
      of tight gene networks and expression clusters that may be necessary to 
      differentially contribute to the progression of dengue infection between the two 
      strains. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that highly correlated differential expression 
      of responsive genes throughout the post infection period in A. aegypti midgut 
      tissues is necessary for a coordinated transcriptional response of the mosquito 
      genes to host or defend the viral infection.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne member of the family Flaviviridae, is a 
      significant global pathogen affecting primarily tropical and subtropical regions of 
      the world and placing tremendous burden on the limited medical infrastructure that 
      exists in many of the developing countries located within these regions. Recent 
      outbreaks in developed countries, including Australia (Hanna et al., 2009), France 
      (La Ruche et al., 2010), Taiwan (Kuan et al., 2010), and the USA (CDC, 2010), lead 
      many researchers to believe that continued emergence into more temperate latitudes 
      is likely. A primary concern is that there are no approved vaccines or antiviral 
      therapies to treat DENV infections. Since the viral NS2B-NS3 protease (DENV 
      NS2B-NS3pro) is required for virus replication, it provides a strategic target for 
      the development of antiviral drugs. In this study, proof-of-concept high-throughput 
      screenings (HTSs) were performed to unambiguously identify dengue 2 virus (DEN2V) 
      NS2B-NS3pro inhibitors from a library of 2000 compounds. Validation screens were 
      performed in parallel to concurrently eliminate insoluble, auto-fluorescing, and/or 
      nonspecific inhibitors. Kinetic analyses of the hits revealed that parallel 
      substrate fluorophore (AMC) interference controls and trypsin inhibition controls 
      were able to reduce false positive rates due to solubility and fluorophore 
      interference while the trypsin inhibition control additionally eliminated 
      non-specific inhibitors. We identified five DEN2V NS2B-NS3pro inhibitors that also 
      inhibited the related West Nile virus (WNV) protease (NS2B-NS3pro), but did not 
      inhibit the trypsin protease. Biochemical analyses revealed various mechanisms of 
      inhibition including competitive and mixed noncompetitive inhibition, with the 
      lowest K(i) values being 12±1.5 μM for DEN2V NS2B-NS3pro and 2±0.2 μM for WNV 
      NS2B-NS3pro.

AB  - The immunogenicity and safety of three novel host-range vaccines containing 
      deletions in the transmembrane domain of dengue virus serotype 2 (DV2) E 
      glycoprotein were evaluated in African green monkeys. The shorter transmembrane 
      domains are capable of functionally spanning an insect but not a mammalian cell 
      membrane, resulting in production of viral mutants that have reduced infectivity in 
      mammalian hosts but efficient growth in insect cells. Groups of four monkeys 
      received one dose each of test vaccine candidate with no booster immunization. After 
      immunization, levels of viremia produced by each vaccine were determined by 
      infectious center assay. Vaccine recipient immune response to wild-type DV2 
      challenge was measured on Day 57 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and plaque 
      reduction neutralization test. Two vaccines, DV2ΔGVII and DV2G460P, generated 
      neutralizing antibody in the range of 700-900 50% plaque reduction neutralization 
      test units. All three vaccine strains decreased the length of viremia by at least 
      two days. No safety concerns were identified.

PG  - 1116-8
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0648 [doi]
AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that dengue infection in Singapore predominantly 
      occurs away from the home, but when and where dengue transmission occurs is unclear, 
      confounding control efforts. The authors estimate days of the week in which dengue 
      inpatients in Singapore were infected during the period 2006-2008, based on the day 
      they became febrile and historical data on the incubation period, using Bayesian 
      statistical methods. Among male inpatients, the relative risk of infection is an 
      estimated 57% higher at the weekend, suggesting infections associated with the home 
      or leisure activities. There was no evidence of elevated risk of infection at the 
      weekend for female inpatients. The study motivates further research identifying 
      locales frequented in the week leading up to onset to improve the effective 
      targeting of vector control efforts.

AB  - This report focuses on a fatality involving severe dengue fever and melioidosis in a 
      28-year-old truck driver residing in Pacoti in northeastern Brazil. He exhibited 
      long-term respiratory symptoms (48 days) and went through a wide-ranging clinical 
      investigation at three hospitals, after initial clinical diagnoses of pneumonia, 
      visceral leishmaniasis, tuberculosis, and fungal sepsis. After death, Burkholderia 
      pseudomallei was isolated in a culture of ascitic fluid. Dengue virus type 1 was 
      detected by polymerase chain reaction in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); this infection 
      was the cause of death. This description reinforces the need to consider melioidosis 
      among the reported differential diagnoses of community-acquired infections where 
      both melioidosis and dengue fever are endemic.

TI  - Extensive structural change of the envelope protein of dengue virus induced by a 
      tuned ionic strength: conformational and energetic analyses.
PG  - 1311-25

AB  - The Dengue has become a global public health threat, with over 100 million 
      infections annually; to date there is no specific vaccine or any antiviral drug. The 
      structures of the envelope (E) proteins of the four known serotype of the dengue 
      virus (DENV) are already known, but there are insufficient molecular details of 
      their structural behavior in solution in the distinct environmental conditions in 
      which the DENVs are submitted, from the digestive tract of the mosquito up to its 
      replication inside the host cell. Such detailed knowledge becomes important because 
      of the multifunctional character of the E protein: it mediates the early events in 
      cell entry, via receptor endocytosis and, as a class II protein, participates 
      determinately in the process of membrane fusion. The proposed infection mechanism 
      asserts that once in the endosome, at low pH, the E homodimers dissociate and insert 
      into the endosomal lipid membrane, after an extensive conformational change, mainly 
      on the relative arrangement of its three domains. In this work we employ all-atom 
      explicit solvent Molecular Dynamics simulations to specify the thermodynamic 
      conditions in that the E proteins are induced to experience extensive structural 
      changes, such as during the process of reducing pH. We study the structural behavior 
      of the E protein monomer at acid pH solution of distinct ionic strength. Extensive 
      simulations are carried out with all the histidine residues in its full protonated 
      form at four distinct ionic strengths. The results are analyzed in detail from 
      structural and energetic perspectives, and the virtual protein movements are 
      described by means of the principal component analyses. As the main result, we found 
      that at acid pH and physiological ionic strength, the E protein suffers a major 
      structural change; for lower or higher ionic strengths, the crystal structure is 
      essentially maintained along of all extensive simulations. On the other hand, at 
      basic pH, when all histidine residues are in the unprotonated form, the protein 
      structure is very stable for ionic strengths ranging from 0 to 225 mM. Therefore, 
      our findings support the hypothesis that the histidines constitute the hot points 
      that induce configurational changes of E protein in acid pH, and give extra 
      motivation to the development of new ideas for antivirus compound design.

TI  - Community mobilization and household level waste management for dengue vector 
      control in Gampaha district of Sri Lanka; an intervention study.
PG  - 479-87
LID - 10.1179/2047773212Y.0000000060 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Waste management through community mobilization to reduce breeding 
      places at household level could be an effective and sustainable dengue vector 
      control strategy in areas where vector breeding takes place in small discarded water 
      containers. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of this 
      assumption. METHODS: An intervention study was conducted from February 2009 to 
      February 2010 in the populous Gampaha District of Sri Lanka. Eight neighborhoods 
      (clusters) with roughly 200 houses each were selected randomly from high and low 
      dengue endemic areas; 4 of them were allocated to the intervention arm (2 in the 
      high and 2 in the low endemicity areas) and in the same way 4 clusters to the 
      control arm. A baseline household survey was conducted and entomological and 
      sociological surveys were carried out simultaneously at baseline, at 3 months, at 9 
      months and at 15 months after the start of the intervention. The intervention 
      programme in the treatment clusters consisted of building partnerships of local 
      stakeholders, waste management at household level, the promotion of composting 
      biodegradable household waste, raising awareness on the importance of solid waste 
      management in dengue control and improving garbage collection with the assistance of 
      local government authorities. RESULTS: The intervention and control clusters were 
      very similar and there were no significant differences in pupal and larval indices 
      of Aedes mosquitoes. The establishment of partnerships among local authorities was 
      well accepted and sustainable; the involvement of communities and households was 
      successful. Waste management with the elimination of the most productive water 
      container types (bowls, tins, bottles) led to a significant reduction of pupal 
      indices as a proxy for adult vector densities. CONCLUSION: The coordination of local 
      authorities along with increased household responsibility for targeted vector 
      interventions (in our case solid waste management due to the type of preferred 
      vector breeding places) is vital for effective and sustained dengue control.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent arbovirus in the world, found mainly in 
      tropical regions. As clinical manifestations present frequently as nonspecific 
      febrile illness, laboratory diagnosis is essential to confirm DENV infections and 
      for epidemiological studies. Recombinant envelope (E) antigens of four serotypes of 
      DENV were used to develop an immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      (IgG-ELISA). To evaluate the IgG-ELISA, a panel of serum samples that had been 
      tested previously by a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was investigated 
      for the presence of anti-E antibodies against the four DENV serotypes. IgG-ELISA was 
      found to have a sensitivity (91%) and specificity (98%) at a receiver-operating 
      characteristic (ROC) optimized cutoff and demonstrated high performance as well as 
      good indexes. A concordance of 97% was achieved between both assays, and only 21/704 
      (3%) samples were not concordant. The results of the present study demonstrate a 
      moderate correlation between neutralizing antibody titers and IgG-ELISA values. 
      These findings indicate that the recombinant protein-based IgG-ELISA is a suitable 
      method for routine serodiagnosis, monitoring and seroepidemiological studies of DENV 
      infections.

TI  - Identification of dengue virus in Aedes mosquitoes and patients' sera from Si Sa Ket 
      Province, Thailand.
PG  - 641-5
AB  - Dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) 
      are the re-emerging infectious diseases caused by dengue (DEN) virus, transmitted by 
      Aedes mosquito. There are more than 100,000 cases of dengue infection and more than 
      100 deaths annually in Thailand. Virological surveillance for DEN viruses is used as 
      an early warning system to predict outbreaks. The seroprevalence of infection and 
      serotypes of DEN virus in 116 pediatric patients at Si Sa Ket Province, Thailand 
      were analyzed during June to September 2004. At the same period, Aedes mosquitoes 
      were caught from patients' and their neighbors' houses, from control houses, located 
      in villages with no report of dengue infection during the previous 3 years. The 
      majority of DHF cases were secondary infections of DEN-2 and DEN-4 serotypes. Of the 
      1,652 Aedes mosquitoes collected 1,583 were Ae. aegypti and 69 Ae. albopictus. Ten 
      mosquitoes from each house were pooled and dengue viruses were determined using 
      RT-PCR assay; only 1 positive pooled was found. Although the dengue infection rate 
      in the field caught mosquitoes was low, the existing dengue virus control program in 
      transmission areas by aerial spraying to destroy the larva breeding sites should be 
      continued.

TI  - Use of serum and blood samples on filter paper to improve the surveillance of Dengue 
      in Pacific Island Countries.
PG  - 23-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jcv.2012.05.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Pacific Island Countries (PICs) the epidemiology of dengue is 
      characterized by long-term transmission of a single dengue virus (DENV) serotype. 
      The emergence of a new serotype in one island country often indicates major 
      outbreaks with this serotype will follow in other PICs. OBJECTIVES: Filter paper 
      (FP) cards on which whole blood or serum from dengue suspected patients had been 
      dried was evaluated as a method for transportation of this material by standard mail 
      delivery throughout the Pacific. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-two FP-dried whole blood 
      samples collected from patients in New Caledonia and Wallis & Futuna Islands, during 
      DENV-1 and DENV-4 transmission, and 76 FP-dried sera collected from patients in Yap 
      State, Majuro (Republic of Marshall Islands), Tonga and Fiji, before and during 
      outbreaks of DENV-2 in Yap State and DENV-4 in Majuro, were tested for the presence 
      of DENV RNA, by serotype specific RT-PCR, at the Institut Louis Malardé in French 
      Polynesia. RESULTS: The serotype of DENV could be determined, by a variety of RT-PCR 
      procedures, in the FP-dried samples after more than three weeks of transport at 
      ambient temperatures. In most cases, the sequencing of the envelope gene to genotype 
      the viruses also was possible. CONCLUSIONS: The serotype and genotype of DENV can be 
      determined from FP-dried serum or whole blood samples transported over thousands of 
      kilometers at ambient, tropical, temperatures. This simple and low-cost approach to 
      virus identification should be evaluated in isolated and resource poor settings for 
      surveillance for a range of significant viral diseases.

AB  - Elevated liver enzyme level is an outstanding feature in patients with dengue. 
      However, the pathogenic mechanism of liver injury has not been clearly demonstrated. 
      In this study, employing a mouse model we aimed to investigate the immunopathogenic 
      mechanism of dengue liver injury. Immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice were infected 
      intravenously with dengue virus strain 16681. Infected mice had transient viremia, 
      detectable viral capsid gene and cleaved caspase 3 in the liver. In the mean time, 
      NK cell and T cell infiltrations peaked at days 1 and 5, respectively. Neutralizing 
      CXCL10 or depletion of Asialo GM1(+) cells reduced cleaved caspase 3 and TUNEL(+) 
      cells in the liver at day 1 after infection. CD8(+) T cells infiltrated into the 
      liver at later time point and at which time intrahepatic leukocytes (IHL) exhibited 
      cytotoxicity against DENV-infected targets. Cleaved caspase 3 and TUNEL(+) cells 
      were diminished in mice with TCRβ deficiency and in those depleted of CD8(+) T 
      cells, respectively, at day 5 after infection. Moreover, intrahepatic CD8(+) T cells 
      were like their splenic counterparts recognized DENV NS4B(99-107) peptide. Together, 
      these results show that infiltrating NK and CD8(+) T cells cause liver cell death. 
      While NK cells were responsible for cell death at early time point of infection, 
      CD8(+) T cells were for later. CD8(+) T cells that recognize NS4B(99-107) constitute 
      at least one of the major intrahepatic cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographics, patterns of assessment and treatment of 
      people visiting a regional emergency department with potential diagnoses of malaria 
      or dengue fever. DESIGN: To identify potential dengue fever cases, we used an 
      indicator of recent overseas travel and fever that is a request for malaria testing. 
      A chart audit of 301 medical records of people between 2008 and 2010 was conducted 
      to describe patient characteristics, diagnostic tests performed and treatment. 
      SETTING: A regional hospital located in the wet tropics. RESULTS: Malaria testing 
      was most often performed on Australian citizens (64.1%), medical evacuees (20.3%) 
      and tourists (18.6%). Overall, 49.8% of patients tested for malaria did not also 
      have a dengue test, despite being indicated in 54% of this group. People tested for 
      malaria usually lived in a residential house or unit (69.7%). Only 9% were staying 
      in hotels and hostels. Oceania was the most commonly visited region in the two weeks 
      prior to presentation. Malaria was diagnosed in 17.3% and dengue fever in 12% of 
      patients tested. Patients with dengue fever were more likely than patients with 
      malaria to self-refer to hospital, be staying in commercial accommodation and to 
      have recently travelled to Southeast Asia. CONCLUSION: Both dengue fever and malaria 
      occur predominantly in residents who reside in non-commercial accommodation. Efforts 
      to identify imported dengue fever cases should focus on both tourists and local 
      residents returning from overseas countries.

TI  - Protein expression in the salivary glands of dengue-infected Aedes aegypti 
      mosquitoes and blood-feeding success.
PG  - 1346-57
AB  - Mosquito salivary glands (SG) play an essential role in food digestion and pathogen 
      transmission. The function of the salivary components during infection is poorly 
      understood. In this study, female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were infected with dengue 
      virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) via an artificial membrane feeding apparatus. The mosquito 
      SGs were examined for DENV-2 infection for 14 days post-infection (dpi). The amount 
      of dengue virus increased throughout the 14 dpi. Three different meals were provided 
      for the Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. SG protein expression was compared among sugar-fed 
      (SF), blood-fed (BF), and dengue-infected blood-fed (DF) mosquitoes using SDS-PAGE 
      coupled with densitometric analysis. The SG of SF mosquitoes had fewer protein bands 
      than those of BF and DF mosquitoes. The major SG proteins seen among BF and DF 
      mosquitoes had molecular weights of 12-15, 25-30, 35-40, 45-50, 55-60 kDa and 61-67 
      kDa. We compared the SG protein band expression profiles in BF and DF mosquitoes. 
      Two bands (35-40 and 61-67 kDa) were expressed more by DF mosquitoes and 3 different 
      bands (25-30, 45-50, and 55-60 kDa) were expressed more by BF mosquitoes. These SG 
      proteins may have some role in facilitating blood-feeding and dengue infection. We 
      speculate these specific SG proteins in dengue-infected mosquitoes may increase the 
      chance of blood-feeding and virus transmission by infected mosquitoes. These results 
      may be useful for designing additional tools to investigate the interaction between 
      Ae. aegypti SG and the dengue virus.

AB  - The prevalence of all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes has increased dramatically 
      in recent years in many tropical and sub-tropical countries accompanied by an 
      increase in genetic diversity within each serotype. This expansion in genetic 
      diversity is expected to give rise to viruses with altered antigenicity, virulence, 
      and transmissibility. We previously demonstrated the co-circulation of multiple DENV 
      genotypes in Thailand and identified a predominant genotype for each serotype. In 
      this study, we performed a comparative analysis of the complete genomic sequences of 
      28 DENV-3 predominant genotype II strains previously collected during different 
      DENV-3 epidemics in Thailand from 1973 to 2001 with the goal to define mutations 
      that might correlate with virulence, transmission frequency, and epidemiological 
      impact. The results revealed (1) 37 amino acid and six nucleotide substitutions 
      adopted and fixed in the virus genome after their initial substitutions over nearly 
      30-year-sampling period, (2) the presence of more amino acid and nucleotide 
      substitutions in recent virus isolates compared with earlier isolates, (3) six amino 
      acid substitutions in capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM), envelope (E), and 
      nonstructural (NS) proteins NS4B and NS5, which appeared to be associated with 
      periods of high DENV-3 epidemic activity, (4) the highest degree of conservation in 
      C, NS2B and the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), and (5) the highest percentage of 
      amino acid substitutions in NS2A protein.

AB  - Flaviviruses are significant causes of disease worldwide and can be classified 
      serologically into several antigenic complexes. The purpose of the present study was 
      to evaluate the effectiveness of a generic RT-nested-PCR for detection of flavivirus 
      during a dengue outbreak in Brazil in 2008. A total of 105 serum samples were 
      collected from patients with fatal outcome and examined by generic RT-PCR, 
      conventional RT-PCR, and IgM serology. The generic RT-PCR confirmed 19 of 105 (18%) 
      cases. Conventional RT-PCR performed on 105 serum samples detected 45 (42.8%) dengue 
      virus infections. The IgM serology confirmed 44 of 102 (43.1%) cases. The infecting 
      serotype was identified by generic RT-PCR in 19 cases (18 DENV-2 and 1 DENV-3) and 
      by conventional RT-PCR in 45 cases (40 DENV-2 and 5 DENV-3). In addition, we 
      analyzed the performance of the generic and conventional RT-PCRs and IgM serology on 
      serum samples stratified by the day of onset of symptoms. Our results indicate that 
      different methods should be included in flavivirus surveillance programs, including 
      virological and serological approaches.

TI  - Endothelial cell surface expression of protein disulfide isomerase activates β1 and 
      β3 integrins and facilitates dengue virus infection.

AB  - Infection with dengue virus (DENV) causes diseases ranging from mild dengue fever to 
      severe hemorrhage or shock syndrome. DENV infection of endothelial cells may cause 
      cell apoptosis or vascular leakage and result in clinical illness of hemorrhage. 
      However, the endothelial cell molecules involved in DENV infection and the 
      mechanisms governing virus-cell interactions are still uncertain. Since protein 
      disulfide isomerase (PDI) reducing function at the cell surface was shown to be 
      required for entry of certain viruses and bacteria, we explored the role of PDI 
      expressed on endothelial cell surface in DENV infection. Using siRNA to knock down 
      PDI, DENV infection was reduced which could be reversed by treating cells with a 
      reducing agent Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). DENV-induced PDI 
      surface expression was mediated through the Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) receptor-Src 
      family kinase signal pathway. Furthermore, cell surface PDI colocalized with β1 and 
      β3 integrins after DENV infection, and the activation of integrins was blocked by 
      PDI inhibition. Finally, blockade of PDI inhibited DENV entry into endothelial 
      cells. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism whereby surface PDI which causes 
      integrin activation is involved in DENV entry, and DENV infection further increases 
      PDI surface expression at later time points. These findings may have implications 
      for anti-DENV drug design.

TI  - A comparative study of clinical features between monotypic and dual infection cases 
      with Chikungunya virus and dengue virus in West Bengal, India.
PG  - 720-3

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are circulating individually in 
      the state of West Bengal, India. However, after 1965 the dual-infection caused by 
      both viruses had not been recorded until 2010. In 2010, an investigation of the 
      febrile cases was carried out to confirm the involvement of both viruses 
      simultaneously. A total of 550 blood samples were tested for the detection of 
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody against both CHIKV and DENV. Serology by the 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method confirmed that 131 (23.8%) and 104 (18.9%) 
      patients had IgM antibody against CHIKV and DENV, respectively, whereas 68 (12.4%) 
      had IgM antibodies against both CHIKV and DENV. Fever, joint pain, rashes, headache, 
      myalgia, and nausea/vomiting are the common features in the case of both monotypic 
      and dual-infection. Severe arthralgia and swelling of joints were common only in 
      CHIKV-positive cases and abdominal pain was mainly associated with DENV infection. 
      Diarrhea was reported only by the dual-infected patients (16.2%).

TI  - Linking oviposition site choice to offspring fitness in Aedes aegypti: consequences 
      for targeted larval control of dengue vectors.
PG  - e1632
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001632 [doi]
LID - e1632
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current Aedes aegypti larval control methods are often insufficient for 
      preventing dengue epidemics. To improve control efficiency and cost-effectiveness, 
      some advocate eliminating or treating only highly productive containers. The 
      population-level outcome of this strategy, however, will depend on details of Ae. 
      aegypti oviposition behavior. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We simultaneously 
      monitored female oviposition and juvenile development in 80 experimental containers 
      located across 20 houses in Iquitos, Peru, to test the hypothesis that Ae. aegypti 
      oviposit preferentially in sites with the greatest potential for maximizing 
      offspring fitness. Females consistently laid more eggs in large vs. small containers 
      (β = 9.18, p<0.001), and in unmanaged vs. manually filled containers (β = 5.33, 
      p<0.001). Using microsatellites to track the development of immature Ae. aegypti, we 
      found a negative correlation between oviposition preference and pupation probability 
      (β = -3.37, p<0.001). Body size of emerging adults was also negatively associated 
      with the preferred oviposition site characteristics of large size (females: 
      β = -0.19, p<0.001; males: β = -0.11, p = 0.002) and non-management (females: 
      β = -0.17, p<0.001; males: β = -0.11, p<0.001). Inside a semi-field enclosure, we 
      simulated a container elimination campaign targeting the most productive oviposition 
      sites. Compared to the two post-intervention trials, egg batches were more clumped 
      during the first pre-intervention trial (β = -0.17, P<0.001), but not the second 
      (β = 0.01, p = 0.900). Overall, when preferred containers were unavailable, the 
      probability that any given container received eggs increased (β = 1.36, p<0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ae. aegypti oviposition site choice can contribute to 
      population regulation by limiting the production and size of adults. Targeted larval 
      control strategies may unintentionally lead to dispersion of eggs among suitable, 
      but previously unoccupied or under-utilized containers. We recommend integrating 
      targeted larval control measures with other strategies that leverage selective 
      oviposition behavior, such as luring ovipositing females to gravid traps or egg 
      sinks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the time between the onset and diagnosis of Dengue fever and its 
      influencing factors in China. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Infectious 
      Disease Surveillance System (IDSS). Descriptive analysis was performed for the time 
      interval while nonparametric tests and logistic regression analysis were used to 
      study the related influencing factors. RESULTS: Time interval appeared positively 
      skewed with distribution at median of 6 days, quartile range as 4 days, while 57.8% 
      of them were longer than five days. Data showed that patients with longer intervals 
      among the imported cases, being elderly, cases in non-endemic season and provinces 
      as Fujian, Yunnan and Zhejiang appeared to have had greater influences on the 
      disease. Median of those imported cases was six days, one day longer than locally 
      generated cases, while median of the non-epidemic month was one day more than that 
      of the epidemic month. In Fujian and Yunnan provinces, the medians were 7 days, one 
      day more than that from Guangdong province. The median among young people was 5 
      days, one day less than that of the patients older than 20 years of age. CONCLUSION: 
      Most Dengue patients did not get diagnosed early enough so it was of urgent need to 
      enhance the sensitivity of the monitoring system, especially in epidemic regions and 
      during non-epidemic season.

AB  - It is important to have appropriate models for the surveillance and control of 
      mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever (DF). These models need to be based on 
      appropriate temporal and spatial scales. The aim of this study was to illustrate the 
      impact of different temporal and spatial scales on DF control decisions. We applied 
      the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic at different temporal and spatial scales to examine the 
      local level of spatial clusters at these scales in order to identify and visualize 
      areas where numbers of adult female Aedes mosquitoes were extreme and geographically 
      homogenous. The modeled hotspot areas were different, depending on whether they were 
      modeled on weekly, monthly or yearly aggregated data. A similar result was found 
      when using different spatial scales for modeling, with different scales giving 
      different hotspot regions. For 2006, the highest risk areas (18 districts) were 
      mostly identified in the central districts with a high rate of similarity (95%) 
      compared to the highest risk areas (19) identified in the averaged five-year period 
      model. Knowledge of appropriate temporal and spatial scales can provide an 
      opportunity to specify the health burden of DF and its vector within the hotspots, 
      as well as set a platform that can help to pursue further investigations into 
      associated factors responsible for increased disease risk based on different 
      temporal and spatial scales.

TI  - Simplifying complex sequence information: a PCP-consensus protein binds antibodies 
      against all four Dengue serotypes.

AB  - Designing proteins that reflect the natural variability of a pathogen is essential 
      for developing novel vaccines and drugs. Flaviviruses, including Dengue (DENV) and 
      West Nile (WNV), evolve rapidly and can "escape" neutralizing monoclonal antibodies 
      by mutation. Designing antigens that represent many distinct strains is important 
      for DENV, where infection with a strain from one of the four serotypes may lead to 
      severe hemorrhagic disease on subsequent infection with a strain from another 
      serotype. Here, a DENV physicochemical property (PCP)-consensus sequence was derived 
      from 671 unique sequences from the Flavitrack database. PCP-consensus proteins for 
      domain 3 of the envelope protein (EdomIII) were expressed from synthetic genes in 
      Escherichia coli. The ability of the purified consensus proteins to bind polyclonal 
      antibodies generated in response to infection with strains from each of the four 
      DENV serotypes was determined. The initial consensus protein bound antibodies from 
      DENV-1-3 in ELISA and Western blot assays. This sequence was altered in 3 steps to 
      incorporate regions of maximum variability, identified as significant changes in the 
      PCPs, characteristic of DENV-4 strains. The final protein was recognized by 
      antibodies against all four serotypes. Two amino acids essential for efficient 
      binding to all DENV antibodies are part of a discontinuous epitope previously 
      defined for a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. The PCP-consensus method can 
      significantly reduce the number of experiments required to define a multivalent 
      antigen, which is particularly important when dealing with pathogens that must be 
      tested at higher biosafety levels.

TI  - Elevated serum levels of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein in 
      dengue-infected patients are associated with disease symptoms and secondary 
      infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) is described as the most prevalent arbovirus, 
      infecting at least 50 million people worldwide. During infection, an intricate 
      network of cytokines, a group of substances closely related to disease severity, is 
      released. Recently, it was observed that both DENV-infected epithelial cells 
      undergoing necrosis and dendritic cells (DCs) are able to release a non-classical 
      pro-inflammatory cytokine called high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). OBJECTIVES: The 
      aim of this study was to evaluate whether HMGB1 levels were altered in DENV-infected 
      patients' sera and whether this augment correlated with disease pathogenesis. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Samples from DENV-infected patients were collected from different days after 
      the onset of symptoms and from patients experiencing primary or secondary infection. 
      The circulating HMGB1 concentration was measured in healthy blood donors as well as 
      in donors with primary and secondary cases of DENV infection by a quantitative 
      capture ELISA assay. RESULTS: We observed that the HMGB1 concentration in 
      DENV-infected patients was significantly higher than in healthy patients. HMGB1 
      levels reached the highest concentration in the first day after the onset of 
      symptoms and decreased throughout the course of the infection. Moreover, we observed 
      that the HMGB1 concentration was augmented during secondary infection as well. 
      CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that HMGB1 levels correlate with disease pathogenesis, 
      specifically with the clinical symptoms and secondary infection, implicating a 
      pro-inflammatory cytokine role for HMGB1 in DENV infection. This is the first report 
      assessing the circulating levels of HMGB1 during DENV infection.

AB  - Anti-viral immune responses have been studied extensively in order to inform 
      rational vaccine design. Following viral infection, the balance of pathologic and 
      protective antibody responses in the host can critically influence clinical 
      outcomes. Comparisons of the different classes of antibodies produced after acute or 
      chronic viral infections have uncovered common features of anti-viral responses, but 
      these analyses have also revealed temporal differences in neutralizing antibody 
      production, variable neutralization potency and differential induction of 
      cross-reactive antibodies. Cross-reactive antibodies are known to play crucial 
      protective roles in host responses to chronic viral infections; recent studies in 
      human immunodeficiency virus long-term controllers have identified a novel class of 
      broadly neutralizing antibodies generated from highly mutated and selected memory B 
      cells. Here, we summarize the various roles played by cross- and poly-reactive 
      antibodies in acute and persistent viral infections, with a focus on the potential 
      contribution of these antibodies to dengue virus (DENV) immunopathology and host 
      protection. Since host antibodies profoundly alter the course of viral infections, 
      effective DENV vaccine design will require a better understanding of the origin, 
      affinity maturation and protective potential of the poly-reactive and cross-reactive 
      antibodies induced by different interventions.

AB  - It is difficult to distinguish dengue fever from other febrile illnesses in a 
      dengue-endemic area. This issue was compounded during the H1N1 2009 pandemic of 
      influenza, which also presents as a febrile illness. This first laboratory-confirmed 
      case of co-infection with dengue and influenza A H1N1 2009 strain in Jeddah, Saudi 
      Arabia, highlights the importance of considering co-infections because not only is 
      influenza an ongoing concern in Jeddah, but several viral hemorrhagic fever viruses 
      circulate in this region.

AB  - Evaluation aims to provide information, promote improvement in programs, and 
      determine the merit and value of the object of evaluation. However, the challenge 
      for evaluators is not only to promote, but also to document the usefulness of 
      studies. Given this challenge, the article aimed to systematize the uses and 
      influence of the process and findings in two evaluations on Brazilian National 
      Dengue Fever Control Program, for decision-making by the respective public health 
      administrators and professionals. Based on a theoretical analytical model, an 
      exploratory study was performed with documental analysis for identification of 
      events and registrations in the evaluations and their circulation in terms of 
      possible uses and influence, from 2007 to 2010. Favorable factors for the use of 
      evaluations were the mode of production of contextual knowledge and definition of 
      evaluations with a focus on utility. The results, indicating greater instrumental 
      use and immediate process and collective use may indicate the studies' pertinence to 
      stakeholders and their usefulness to program management at different levels in the 
      health system.

AB  - Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, continues expanding its geographic range 
      and involvement in mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya and dengue. Vector 
      control programs rarely attempt to suppress this diurnal species with an ultra-low 
      volume (ULV) adulticide because for maximum efficacy applications are conducted at 
      night. During 2009-2011 we performed experimental nighttime applications of a novel 
      adulticide (DUET®) against field populations of Ae. albopictus within an urban site 
      composed of approximately 1,000 parcels (home and yard) in northeastern USA. Dual 
      applications at mid label rate of the adulticide spaced one or two days apart 
      accomplished significantly higher control (85.0 ± 5.4% average reduction) than 
      single full rate applications (73.0 ± 5.4%). Our results demonstrate that nighttime 
      ULV adulticiding is effective in reducing Ae. albopictus abundance and highlight its 
      potential for use as part of integrated pest management programs and during disease 
      epidemics when reducing human illness is of paramount importance.

TI  - Field comparison of thermal and non-thermal ultra-low-volume applications using 
      water and diesel as solvents for managing dengue vector, Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 1274-80

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness on Aedes aegypti (Linneo) (Diptera: 
      Culicidae) of a larvicide-adulticide ULV formulation applied by a thermal or a cold 
      fogger using different solvents. METHODS: We applied, in field conditions, a ULV 
      formulation containing pyriproxyfen and permethrin, using a thermal and a cold 
      fogger and water or diesel as solvent. We determined the effectiveness of these 
      applications on Ae. aegypti adults and larvae by different bioassays and measuring 
      Breteau, house and adult indices. RESULTS: When water was used as solvent, the 
      treatments applied with the cold or the thermal foggers were equally effective on 
      adult mortality (close to 90%) and adult emergence inhibition (% EI) (close to 70%). 
      When the thermal fogger was used with water as solvent, the adult mortality outside 
      the houses (85%) was higher, but not significantly different, than with diesel 
      (65%). The contrary happens inside (22%vs. 58%), while there were no differences in 
      %EI. Adult and larval indices behaved similarly in all areas, with a slight tendency 
      for the treatments applied using water as solvent to be more effective. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Water-based formulations are equally or more effective than the one applied with 
      diesel as solvent. The use of water as solvent will not only improve the 
      effectiveness of this formulation but also reduce the environmental impact and costs 
      of spraying compared to the use of diesel.

TI  - [Evaluation of the SD Dengue Duo diagnosis system for detection of NS1 protein and 
      IgM and IgG dengue antibodies].
PG  - 27-34
AB  - INTRODUCTION: SD Dengue Duo (Standard Diagnosis) commercial kit is an 
      immunochromatographic rapid test that detects NS1 protein and IgG/IgM dengue 
      antibodies simultaneously. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the operational and functional 
      characteristics of this system for the detection of virological and serological 
      markers. METHODS: sera panel was made up by 161 samples, 113 from patients with 
      clinically and serologically confirmed dengue caused by any of the four dengue virus 
      serotypes and 48 negative samples. All these samples were tested by SD Dengue Duo 
      Kit and by Platelia Dengue NSI Ag, IgM Capture ELISA and ELISA Inhibition Method 
      used as reference assays. RESULTS: the evaluated kit showed a 57.75% sensitivity for 
      the detection of NS1 protein, false negatives were detected in samples collected 5 
      days or more after fever onset in secondary infection cases. IgM detection showed 
      96.0% sensitivity and 98.4% specificity. Furthermore, high agreement (95.7%) in 
      classifying dengue infection types (primary or secondary infections) was observed. 
      The global study of the 3 markers, the sensitivity rose to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: SD 
      Dengue Duo is a simple, easy and rapid assay; it does not require additional 
      equipment, can be used for acute and convalescence serum samples and offers a good 
      alternative for dengue diagnosis in those laboratories where a complete dengue virus 
      diagnosis is difficult to perform.

TI  - Effects of ribavirin and hydroxyurea on oral infection of Aedes aegypti (L.) with 
      dengue virus.
PG  - 1358-64
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the inhibitory effects of ribavirin and 
      hydroxyurea on dengue virus replication in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Female Ae. 
      aegypti mosquitoes were infected with dengue-2 virus and fed ribavirin at a dose of 
      0.3 mg/ml and/or hydroxyurea at a dose of 6 mg/ml via artificial membrane feeding 
      technique. The virus in infected mosquitoes was isolated using C6/36 cell culture. 
      Peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) staining was used to detect dengue-infected C6/36 
      cells and to quantify the level of infection by determining the presence of infected 
      cells. In mosquitoes treated with ribavirin alone, hydroxyurea alone or both drugs 
      in combination had reductions in dengue infection rates of 87.72, 89.47 and 95.61%, 
      respectively. The mortalities of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes fed with these drugs 
      were significantly higher than the control. Ribavirin also had an inhibitory effect 
      on the fecundity of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.

PG  - 987-91

AB  - We previously tested in monkeys the P64k-DomIII fusion protein of DEN-2 (PD5), 
      combined with the serogroup A capsular polysaccharide (CPS-A) from N. meningitidis 
      as an immunopotentiator. The results revealed the induction of neutralizing 
      antibodies and partial protection after DEN-2 challenge. Since one formulation of 
      the CPS-A was only evaluated in monkeys, in the present study, we evaluated two 
      CPS-A-based formulations in mice. Animals immunized with PD5 in alum with the 
      highest dose of CPS-A produced the highest levels of INF-γ secretion upon viral 
      stimulation, and accordingly, 100% protection. This is the first report that 
      describes the dose effect of CPS-A and its capacity to potentiate the cell-mediated 
      immunity induced by a heterologous antigen in mice.

TI  - Emergence of dengue virus 4 genotype II in Guangzhou, China, 2010: survey and 
      molecular epidemiology of one community outbreak.
PG  - 87
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-12-87 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The re-emergence of dengue virus 4 (DENV-4) has become a public health 
      concern in South America, Southeast Asia and South Asia. However, it has not been 
      known to have caused a local outbreak in China for the past 20 years. The purpose of 
      this study was to elucidate the epidemiology of one local community outbreak caused 
      by DENV-4 in Guangzhou city, China, in 2010; and to determine the molecular 
      characteristics of the genotype II virus involved. CASE PRESENTATIONS: During 
      September and October of 2010, one imported case, a Guangzhou resident who travelled 
      back from Thailand, resulted in 18 secondary autochthonous cases in Guangzhou City, 
      with an incidence rate of 5.53 per 10,000 residents. In indigenous cases, 14 serum 
      samples tested positive for IgM against DENV and 7 for IgG from a total of 15 
      submitted serum samples, accompanied by 5 DENV-4 isolates. With identical envelope 
      gene nucleotide sequences, the two isolates (D10168-GZ from the imported index case 
      and Guangzhou 10660 from the first isolate in the autochthonous cases) were grouped 
      into DENV-4 genotype II after comparison to 32 previous DENV-4 isolates from GenBank 
      that originated from different areas. CONCLUSIONS: Based on epidemiological and 
      phylogenetic analyses, the outbreak, which was absent for 20 years after the DENV-4 
      genotype I outbreak in 1990, was confirmed as DENV-4 genotype II and initially 
      traced to the imported index case, a Guangzhou resident who travelled back from 
      Thailand.

TI  - [Severe liver cytolysis could be a marker of the severity of hemorrhagic dengue: 
      report of two cases].
PG  - 87-90
AB  - We report two cases of severe dengue fever in persons returned from stays in endemic 
      areas during the summer outbreak of 2010. Both presented a hemorrhagic syndrome 
      associated with primary hemostasis disorders, neutropenia, and severe hepatic 
      cytolysis without any hepatocellular insufficiency. Three days after 
      hospitalization, the first patient's AST and ALT levels rose to 80 and 12 times the 
      upper reference values respectively, and the second patient's to 12 and 7 times 
      those values. The second also presented signs of hemodynamic shock. Our observations 
      suggest that the combination of severe hepatic cytolysis and hemostatic disorders 
      may be a predictive marker of the severity of dengue fever. The pathophysiologic 
      mechanisms explaining this severity remain unknown.

TI  - Revisiting Houston and Memphis: the background histories behind the discovery of the 
      infestation by Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in the United States and their 
      significance in the contemporary research.
PG  - 1163-76
AB  - The discovery of Aedes albopictus Skuse infestation in Texas in 1985 and subsequent 
      global spread of this mosquito have spawned a large number of publications 
      worldwide. The unique discovery in this episode was used tire trade as mechanism by 
      which this exotic mosquito was introduced to the United States. While most 
      researchers have focused their attention primarily on recent events and scientific 
      progress, far fewer examined in depth early contributions made in the United States 
      still very much relevant for contemporary discussion and other important subjects 
      associated with its infestation. The first part of this review covers early 
      background histories of research on Ae. albopictus in the institutions in the United 
      States and of introduction of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti to the U.S. territories 
      in the eastern Pacific as well as dengue outbreaks therein. The second part covers 
      evolution of recognition of the importance of tire as breeding site of domesticated 
      or peridomestic dengue vectors and of its transport in the dispersal of these 
      mosquitoes. In the third part, the significance of vector-borne viral disease 
      outbreak potential of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti in temperate regions and a 
      variety of problems concerning vector spread and commercial practices learned in the 
      past are reassessed in the context of contemporary research. I further identified as 
      byproducts of this review two potentially important epidemiological mechanisms in 
      the transmission of dengue in temperate regions, increasing tendency of indoor 
      activity of Ae. albopictus and massive human movement associated with unpredictable 
      political development.

PG  - 589-98
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to describe the dengue fever mortality. METHODS: a descriptive and 
      retrospective study including 104 files reported deaths caused by dengue fever 
      during 2009 to march 2010, was done. RESULTS: sixty (58 %) were women and 44 (42 %) 
      men. An increased mortality between the ages of 11 and 40 years old (47 %) was 
      observed. Colima was a state with high incidence of cases and Jalisco had the 
      highest mortality. Thrombocytopenia was the rule (90.4 %) and in one third of the 
      cases platelets were below 50,000/mm(3). A quarter of cases were associated with 
      comorbility. The initial clinical manifestations included: bleeding, hypovolemia by 
      depletion or hemorrhage, tachycardia, paleness, depressed level of consciousness and 
      circulatory failure. The main cause of death was hypovolemic shock or sepsis. In 42 
      cases, severe dengue was considered. CONCLUSIONS: an association between the 
      severity of dengue fever and mortality was observed. The main cause of mortality was 
      a shock state.

TI  - Spray application of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti strain AM65-52) against 
      Aedes aegypti (L.) and Ae. albopictus Skuse populations and impact on dengue 
      transmission in a dengue endemic residential site in Malaysia.
PG  - 296-310
AB  - A one year study was conducted to evaluate the impact of spray application of 
      Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), strain AM65-52 on vector populations and 
      dengue transmission in a dengue endemic state in Malaysia. Residential sites with 
      similar populations of Aedes aegypti (L.) and Aedes albopictus Skuse were studied. 
      One site was treated with spray application of Bti into all outdoor target vector 
      habitats, which consisted of natural and artificial containers. The other site was 
      not treated. The impact of spray application was measured with an indoor and outdoor 
      ovitrap index (OI) and epidemiologic data. Significant reductions in both Ae. 
      aegypti and Ae. albopictus, OI were observed both indoors and outdoors, in treated 
      sites compared to untreated sites (p < 0.05). OI reduction was achieved over time in 
      the treated area. The OI was suppressed to below 10%. This was maintained for 4 
      weeks into the post-treatment phase. The outdoor OI at the untreated site remained 
      at more than 40% for 38 weeks during the evaluation period. One dengue case occurred 
      at the Bti treatment site at the beginning of the treatment phase, but no further 
      cases were detected during the remainder of the treatment phase. However, there was 
      an ongoing dengue outbreak in the untreated area with 15 serologically confirmed 
      cases during weeks 37-54. Intensive fogging operations with pyrethroids at the 
      untreated (Bti) site had a positive impact on Ae. albopictus, but not on Ae. 
      aegypti.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is highly endemic in Chennai city, South India, in spite of 
      continuous vector control efforts. This intervention study was aimed at establishing 
      the efficacy as well as the favouring and limiting factors relating to a 
      community-based environmental intervention package to control the dengue vector 
      Aedes aegypti. METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial was designed to 
      measure the outcome of a new vector control package and process analysis; different 
      data collection tools were used to determine the performance. Ten randomly selected 
      intervention clusters (neighbourhoods with 100 houses each) were paired with ten 
      control clusters on the basis of ecological/entomological indices and sociological 
      parameters collected during baseline studies. In the intervention clusters, Aedes 
      control was carried out using a community-based environmental management approach 
      like provision of water container covers through community actors, clean-up 
      campaigns, and dissemination of dengue information through schoolchildren. The main 
      outcome measure was reduction in pupal indices (pupae per person index), used as a 
      proxy measure of adult vectors, in the intervention clusters compared to the control 
      clusters. RESULTS: At baseline, almost half the respondents did not know that dengue 
      is serious but preventable, or that it is transmitted by mosquitoes. The stakeholder 
      analysis showed that dengue vector control is carried out by vertically structured 
      programmes of national, state, and local administrative bodies through fogging and 
      larval control with temephos, without any involvement of community-based 
      organizations, and that vector control efforts were conducted in an isolated and 
      irregular way. The most productive container types for Aedes pupae were cement 
      tanks, drums, and discarded containers. All ten intervention clusters with a total 
      of 1000 houses and 4639 inhabitants received the intervention while the ten control 
      clusters with a total of 1000 houses and 4439 inhabitants received only the routine 
      government services and some of the information education and communication project 
      materials. The follow-up studies showed that there was a substantial increase in 
      dengue understanding in the intervention group with only minor knowledge changes in 
      the control group. Community involvement and the partnership among stakeholders 
      (particularly women's self-help groups) worked well. After 10 months of 
      intervention, the pupae per person index was significantly reduced to 0·004 pupae 
      per person from 1·075 (P = 0·020) in the intervention clusters compared to control 
      clusters. There were also significant reductions in the Stegomyia indices: the house 
      index was reduced to 4·2%, the container index to 1·05%, and the Breteau index to 
      4·3 from the baseline values of 19·6, 8·91, and 30·8 in the intervention arm. 
      CONCLUSION: A community-based approach together with other stakeholders that 
      promoted interventions to prevent dengue vector breeding led to a substantial 
      reduction in dengue vector density.

TI  - [Biological properties of virus dengue-3 strains isolated during the epidemic 
      ocurred in Havana, 2001-2002].
PG  - 187-98
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During dengue epidemics in Cuba, an increase in clinical severity with 
      the epidemics progression in time, particularly in secondary infections, have been 
      frequently observed. It is considered that this increase could be related with 
      genetic changes in the circulating virus. OBJECTIVE: To study some biological 
      attributes related to strains isolated at different points of time during the dengue 
      epidemic occurred in Havana city, 2001-2002. METHODS: Nine DENV-3 strains were 
      studied. Cytopathogenic effect, viral growth in C6/36 HT and Vero cell lines, viral 
      plaque sizes, temperature sensitivity, neurovirulence in newborn mice and pH 
      influence in the binding of the virus and the cell as well as in the multiplication 
      medium were evaluated. RESULTS: DENV-3 strains were more cytopathogenic in Vero 
      Cells. However, higher titres were obtained in C6/36 HT cells. All the strains 
      showed reduction of viral titres and plaque size with temperature increasing and low 
      neurovirulence. Basic pH favoured virus-cell binding whereas acid pH was only 
      permissive for some strains isolated at the end of the epidemic. On the other hand, 
      at pH 6.5-7, the viral multiplication medium favoured the growth of strains isolated 
      at the beginning of the epidemic whereas the growth of those isolated at the endof 
      the epidemic was noticeable at pH 7-8. CONCLUSIONS: This study proved the 
      phenotypical changes among strains isolated at different points of time in the 
      epidemic. They might be related to differences in viral fitness or in virulent 
      potential. Nevertheless, some of the studied biological properties suggest that 
      dengue virus-3 strains are less virulent than the Cuban dengue virus 2 strains 
      isolated in 1997.

TI  - KAP study conducted to assess the impact of special health education campaign for 
      control of dengue at Vellore in Tamil Nadu.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - An abnormal increase in the incidence of dengue was reported at Vellore Corporation 
      since September 2012. Intensive control operations supported with health education 
      campaigns were carried out from September to November 2012 till the outbreak 
      situation subsided. During December 2012, a cross sectional survey was conducted at 
      Vellore Corporation to assess the impact of the health education campaigns on the 
      knowledge, attitude and practice in the community and also to assess future needs. A 
      total of 101 families from four different locations at Vellore corporation were 
      interviewed on pre-structured formats. Though 80% of the respondents felt that 
      dengue could be effectively prevented and controlled only with community 
      participation, majority of them lacked awareness on the day time biting behaviour of 
      Aedes mosquitos, their indoor resting and breeding habits and relevance of specific 
      control measures focused on the bionomics of dengue vectors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resequencing DNA microarray (RMA) technology uses probes designed to 
      identify a panel of viral sequences. It can be used for detecting emerging viruses 
      by revealing the nucleotide polymorphisms within the target of interest. 
      OBJECTIVES/STUDY DESIGN: As a new tool for molecular diagnosis of arbovirus 
      infection, high density PathogenID v2.0 RMA (PID2-RMA) was assessed for the 
      detection and genetic analysis of dengue, West Nile, and Chikungunya viruses in 
      spiked blood samples or sera from individuals infected with dengue virus. Viral RNAs 
      extracted from biological samples were retrotranscribed into cDNA and amplified 
      using the Phi 29 polymerase-based method. This amplified cDNA was used for 
      hybridization on PID2-RMA. RESULTS: A good specificity of RMA-based detection was 
      demonstrated using a panel of arboviruses including Dengue, West Nile and 
      Chikungunya viruses. This technology was also efficient for the detection and 
      genetic analysis of the different serotypes of dengue virus in sera of infected 
      patients. Furthermore, the mixing of dengue, West Nile and Chikungunya prototype 
      viruses within a single sample of human blood did not interfere with the sensitivity 
      of PID2-RMA. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that high density PID2-RMA was suitable for 
      the identification of medically important arboviruses. It appears to be particularly 
      adapted to the genetic analysis of dengue, West Nile, and Chikungunya viruses in 
      urgent clinical situations where the rapid identification and characterization of 
      the pathogen is essential.

TI  - A study exploring the knowledge, attitudes and practices of young people regarding 
      dengue fever and the extent of community involvement in vector control of the 
      disease in Trinidad and Tobago.
PG  - 615-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study intends to explore young people's knowledge, attitudes and 
      practices regarding dengue fever in Trinidad and Tobago. METHODS: Interviews and 
      focus groups were carried out with young people studying at the University of 
      Trinidad and Tobago. Thematic analysis was then conducted on these scripts and 
      recommendations for improvement were made. RESULTS: All participants had some 
      knowledge about dengue fever; however the extent of this knowledge varied greatly. 
      Participants knew most about the mode of spread and symptoms. All participants did 
      something at home as a means of vector control of the disease; ensuring no stagnant 
      water was present in containers in the yard was the most popular method of vector 
      control. All participants were aware that the government sprayed the neighbourhoods 
      against mosquitoes; however the majority thought they did not do this often enough. 
      CONCLUSION: Following the results of this study, three recommendations were made: 
      the government should spray on a more regular basis, particularly just before the 
      rainy season; a pilot study should take place investigating whether a fining scheme 
      would improve vector control and dengue fever health education should be improved.

TI  - Management of thrombocytopenia and flu-like symptoms in dengue patients with herbal 
      water of Euphorbia hirta.
PG  - 6-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Incidence of dengue increased 30 fold between 1960 and 2010. This 
      increase is believed to be due to a combination of urbanisation, population growth, 
      increased international travel, and global warming. We tried to find out the effect 
      of herbal water of Tawa-tawa, also called Euphorbia hirta, on the flu like symptoms 
      and blood parameters especially on thrombocytopenia. METHODS: Total 125 patients 
      with confirmed dengue fever admitted in medical ward of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital 
      Lahore were included in this experimental study. Duration of study was 3 months. 
      Patients were divided into 2 groups, i.e., group A (ages between 30 to 55 years) and 
      group B (ages between 14 to 25 years). A blood sample was obtained on the day of 
      enrolment and after 24 hours of using Tawa-tawa. The variables used were platelet 
      count, haematocrit (HCT), WBC count, serum AST, ALT, IgM/IgG. RESULTS: In men, 
      platelet count was < 25,000 and in women, it was > 50,000. Haematocrit were >40% in 
      men and 30-40% in women. TLC in a range of 4,000-11,000/mm3 was observed in both 
      males and females. IgM 'haemagglutination' antibody titres (> 1:160) was observed in 
      71.3% females and 50% males. Serum AST was > 40 IU/L in 38% females and 36% males. 
      Serum ALT was > 40 IU/L in 9.5% females and 12% males. In both group A and B 
      platelet count and TLC were increased nonsignificantly after herbal water of 
      Euphorbia hirta (E. Hirta). Haematocrit value decreased nonsignificantly after using 
      the herbal water. Over 70% of patients showed moderate increase in their platelet 
      count. However leucopoenia improved significantly after the use of aqueous extract 
      of E. hirta. A marked recovery in fever and flu like symptoms was observed. 
      CONCLUSION: In over 70% patients there was improvement in platelet count, TLC, 
      fever, and flue-like symptoms.

TI  - The key breeding sites by pupal survey for dengue mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti 
      (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse), in Guba, Cebu City, Philippines.
PG  - 1365-74
AB  - We conducted this study to assess how well a pupal survey of dengue mosquito 
      vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, is able to target the most productive 
      breeding sites. The study was carried out monthly during the rainy season (8 months) 
      in 2008 in Cuba, Cebu City, Philippines. The hypotheses tested were: 1) most pupae 
      of Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus were produced in a few types of breeding sites and 
      2) the most productive types of breeding sites for each species were the most 
      abundant. Approximately 2,500 pupae were collected from 554 breeding sites in 279 
      houses. Thirty-eight point four percent of ten types of breeding sites were positive 
      for Ae. aegypti, and 11.9% of nine types of sites were positive for Ae. albopictus. 
      Plastic drums (40.2%), metal drums (29.6%), and plastic containers (10.5%) were the 
      key sites for Ae. aegypti pupae, whereas bamboo stumps (28.5%), plastic drums 
      (21.1%), and rubber tires (19.1%) were the key sites for Ae. albopictus. The most 
      productive breeding sites for Ae. aegypti were common but not the most common for 
      Ae. albopictus. These results are relevant for dengue vector control programs.

PG  - 112-8
LID - 10.1109/TITB.2011.2171978 [doi]
AB  - Identification of the influential clinical symptoms and laboratory features that 
      help in the diagnosis of dengue fever (DF) in early phase of the illness would aid 
      in designing effective public health management and virological surveillance 
      strategies. Keeping this as our main objective, we develop in this paper a new 
      computational intelligence-based methodology that predicts the diagnosis in real 
      time, minimizing the number of false positives and false negatives. Our methodology 
      consists of three major components: 1) a novel missing value imputation procedure 
      that can be applied on any dataset consisting of categorical (nominal) and/or 
      numeric (real or integer); 2) a wrapper-based feature selection method with genetic 
      search for extracting a subset of most influential symptoms that can diagnose the 
      illness; and 3) an alternating decision tree method that employs boosting for 
      generating highly accurate decision rules. The predictive models developed using our 
      methodology are found to be more accurate than the state-of-the-art methodologies 
      used in the diagnosis of the DF.

PG  - 1273-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of Dengue and the E 
      gene of the new isolated strains. METHODS: Epidemiological data and serum samples 
      were collected. Serotypes were detected by real-time PCR and virus was isolated in 
      C6/36. E gene of the new isolated strains were sequenced and analyzed by Mega 4.0. 
      RESULTS: The cases of Dengue reached at the peak during September and November, with 
      Serotype 1, 2 and 4 were involved. Five strains of serotype l were isolated, with 4 
      of them fell into the clad of Asia genotype, and 1 belonged to America/Africa 
      genotype. CONCLUSION: The strains isolated in Guangzhou showed a high identity to 
      the Southeast Asian strains. There seemed high risk of outbreak of Dengue in this 
      area, However, the Dengue virus might have already been localized.

TI  - High-resolution crystal structure of FKBP12 from Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 1080-4
LID - 10.1002/pro.2079 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is one of the most infectious viral diseases prevalent mainly in tropical 
      countries. The virus is transmitted by Aedes species of mosquito, primarily Aedes 
      aegypti. Dengue remains a challenging drug target for years as the virus eludes the 
      immune responses. Currently, no vaccines or antiviral drugs are available for dengue 
      prevention. Previous studies suggested that the immunosuppressive drug FK506 shows 
      antimalarial activity, and its molecular target, FK506-binding protein (FKBP), was 
      identified in the Plasmodium parasite. Likewise, a FKBP family protein has been 
      identified in A. aegypti (AaFKBP12) in which AaFKBP12 is assumed to play a similar 
      role in its life cycle. FKBPs belong to a highly conserved class of proteins and are 
      considered as an attractive pharmacological target. Herein, we present a 
      high-resolution crystal structure of AaFKBP12 at 1.3 Å resolution and discuss its 
      structural features throwing light in facilitating the design of potential 
      antagonists against the dengue-transmitting mosquito.

TI  - [Analysis of serum neutralizing antibody response in patients with primary dengue 
      virus type 1 infection].
PG  - 1773-6, 1791
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics and dynamic changes of serum 
      neutralizing antibody response in patients with primary infection of dengue virus 
      type 1 (DENV-1). METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from the same patients with 
      primary infection of DENV-1 within 2 weeks after symptom onset in 2006 and in 2010. 
      A group-specific DENV NS1 capture ELISA-based micro-neutralizing test (ELISA-MNT) 
      capable of detecting neutralizing antibodies against all the 4 serotypes of DENV was 
      used to test the neutralizing antibody titers against DENV in the serum samples. The 
      neutralizing antibody titers against a standard strain and 2 clinically isolated 
      strains of DENV-1 were detected in serum samples collected in 2010. RESULTS: 
      Cross-reactive neutralizing antibody response against all the 4 serotypes of DENV 
      was found in both of the serum samples collected in 2006 and 2010, but the samples 
      collected in 2006 showed stronger cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses. 
      The neutralizing antibody against DENV-2, rather than the anticipated DENV-1 
      antibody, had the highest titer in the samples collected in 2006, whereas the 
      antibody against homologous DENV-1 had the highest titer in the samples obtained in 
      2010. The neutralizing antibody titers against the homologous DENV-1 was 
      significantly higher in samples collected in 2010 (U=86.500, P=0.000), which also 
      demonstrated significantly different neutralizing antibody titers against the 3 
      different strains of DENV-1 (Χ(2)=12.123, P=0.002). CONCLUSION: The production of 
      cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies between the 4 serotypes of DENV is a 
      characteristic of DENV infection, particularly during early infection, but only the 
      homologous neutralizing antibody increases obviously over time. The titers of the 
      neutralizing antibodies against different strains, even of the same serotype, may 
      differ distinctly.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Understanding cultural dimensions concerning Mexican and Colombian 
      healthcare workers suffering from dengue to produce information and elements for 
      healthcare and prevention. METHOD: This was a cognitive anthropological study. 
      Purposive sampling was used to select 197 healthcare workers in Morelia, Mexico, and 
      Santiago de Cali, Colombia; free associations lists and pile sorting were used. 
      Terms associated with the concept of dengue and conceptual dimension groups were 
      investigated. RESULTS: Participants cultural conceptions regarding dengue in Mexico 
      emphasised prevention, whilst those in Colombia concentrated on biomedical language 
      and symptoms. Overall, a holistic vision was shown which included a medical vision 
      and related social aspects. CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals require more 
      information about dengue and its prevention.

TI  - Evidence of polyandry for Aedes aegypti in semifield enclosures.
PG  - 635-41
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0225 [doi]
AB  - Female Aedes aegypti are assumed to be primarily monandrous (i.e., mate only once in 
      their lifetime), but true estimates of mating frequency have not been determined 
      outside the laboratory. To assess polyandry in Ae. aegypti with first-generation 
      progeny from wild mosquitoes, stable isotope semen-labeled males ((15)N or (13)C) 
      were allowed to mate with unlabeled females in semifield enclosures (22.5 m(3)) in a 
      dengue-endemic area in southern Mexico. On average, 14% of females were positive for 
      both labels, indicating that they received semen from more than one male. Our 
      results provide evidence of a small but potentially significant rate of multiple 
      mating within a 48-hour period and provide an approach for future open-field studies 
      of polyandry in this species. Polyandry has implications for understanding mosquito 
      ecology, evolution, and reproductive behavior as well as genetic strategies for 
      mosquito control.

TI  - [Residual effectiveness of temephos observed in a Mexican southeast city affected by 
      dengue].
PG  - 176-86
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of water extraction and renewal on the residual 
      action of temephos applied at 1ppm to cement water-storage containers at home. 
      METHODS: The study was conducted in two stages: one, determination of the granular 
      temephos effectiveness on wild Aedes aegypti populations in order to set the 
      monitoring baseline; and second, the measurement of the mean rate of water 
      extraction at home and its effect on the residual activity of temephos. RESULTS: The 
      effectiveness of granular temephos was CL95 = 0.095 ppm (IC95%: 0.079-0.118). As 
      average, it was found that 69.2% of water stored in cement containers was daily used 
      and renewed, which means significant dilution. For the purpose of simplifying the 
      experiments on residual activity, water was extracted and renewed at a rate of 50% 
      every day for 2 weeks. It was found that temephos effectiveness significantly 
      declined from day 7 on after application. CONCLUSIONS: This rate of water extraction 
      under study has an important effect on the residual activity of temephos. If this 
      rate and the CL95 of granular temephos are considered in estimating the dosing, 
      positive effects on the control of Aedes aegypti and more likely on the occurrence 
      of resistance will be attained.

TI  - Insecticide susceptibility status of field-collected Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.) 
      at a dengue endemic site in Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia.
PG  - 34-47
AB  - Biweekly ovitrap surveillance (OS) was conducted for a year (August 2007 - September 
      2008) at two different dengue endemic sites in Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia, 50 km 
      from Kuala Lumpur. Aedes aegypti collected from these 2 locations were raised to the 
      F3 stage and subjected to a WHO standard bioassay method to determine lethal time 
      (LT) against pyrethroids (permethrin 0.75%, cyfluthrin 0.15%), organophosphates 
      (malathion 5.0%, fenitrothion 1.0%), carbamates (propoxur 0.1%, bendiocarb 0.1%) and 
      organochlorine (DDT 4.0%). Insecticide susceptibilities were analyzed for one year. 
      Aedes aegypti were resistant to DDT with a mortality range of 0 - 13.3% throughout 
      the year at both sites. Susceptibilities to pyrethroids and carbamates varied 
      throughout the year. In contrast, susceptibilities to pyrethroids and carbamates 
      varied throughout the year: resistant to propoxur, bendiocarb and permethrin with 
      mortality of < 80% in most months; but, showed incipient resistant to cyfluthrin in 
      most months. Mosquitoes were consistently susceptible to malathion and fenitrothion, 
      with complete mortality during most months. They were especially susceptible to 
      malathion with LT50 values of 21.32 - 36.37 minutes, suggesting effectiveness of 
      malathion for control of dengue.

AB  - In this paper we address the problem of estimating the parameters of Markov jump 
      processes modeling epidemics and introduce a novel method to conduct inference when 
      data consists on partial observations in one of the state variables. We take the 
      classical stochastic SIR model as a case study. Using the inverse-size expansion of 
      van Kampen we obtain approximations for the first and second moments of the state 
      variables. These approximate moments are in turn matched to the moments of an 
      inputed Generic Discrete distribution aimed at generating an approximate likelihood 
      that is valid both for low count or high count data. We conduct a full Bayesian 
      inference using informative priors. Estimations and predictions are obtained both in 
      a synthetic data scenario and in two Dengue fever case studies.

AB  - Re-emergence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in West Bengal was detected after almost 
      40 years when an outbreak of fever occurred in Baduria village (West Bengal, India) 
      in October 2006. The symptoms of CHIKV infection are similar to those of dengue 
      virus (DENV) infection. Serum samples were tested for detection of IgM antibody to 
      CHIKV and DENV and the aetiological agent was detected as CHIKV. RT-PCR was carried 
      out for confirmation of CHIKV infection. By 2009, CHIKV had spread rapidly within 
      ten districts of West Bengal. Middle-aged women (age group 31-40 years) were 
      predominantly affected. Here we report the analysis of 2134 serum samples collected 
      during 2006-2009 from the different districts of West Bengal, among which IgM 
      antibody to CHIKV and DENV was detected in 403 and 199 samples, respectively. This 
      report highlights the gradual dominating activity of CHIKV with dengue-like clinical 
      features in dengue-endemic regions such as West Bengal.

AB  - Oropouche fever is the second most frequent arboviral infection in Brazil, surpassed 
      only by dengue. Oropouche virus (OROV) causes large and explosive outbreaks of acute 
      febrile illness in cities and villages in the Amazon and Central-Plateau regions. 
      Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 110 meningoencephalitis patients were 
      analyzed. The RNA extracted from fluid was submitted to reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing to identify OROV. Three CSF 
      samples showed the presence of OROV causing infection in the central nervous system 
      (CNS). These patients are adults. Two of the patients had other diseases affecting 
      CNS and immune systems: neurocysticercosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 
      respectively. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the OROV from the CSF of 
      these patients belonged to genotype I. We show here that severe Oropouche disease is 
      occurring during outbreaks of this virus in Brazil.

AB  - Counts of immature stages of the mosquito Aedes aegypti have been used to calculate 
      several entomological indices of dengue vector abundance. Some studies have 
      concluded that these indices can be used as indicators of dengue epidemic risk, 
      while other studies have failed to find a predictive relationship. Ecological niche 
      models have been able to predict distributional patterns in space and time, not only 
      of vectors, but also of the diseases that they transmit. In this study, we used 
      Landsat 7 ETM+ images and two niche-modeling algorithms to estimate the 
      local-landscape ecological niche and the dynamics of Ae. aegypti larval habitats in 
      Bello, Colombia, and to evaluate their potential spatial and temporal distribution. 
      Our models showed low omission error with high confidence levels: about 13.4% of the 
      area presents conditions consistently suitable for breeding across the entire study 
      period (2002-2008). The proportion of neighborhoods predicted to be suitable showed 
      a positive association with dengue case rates, whereas the vector-focused Bretau 
      index had no relationship to case rates. As a consequence, niche models appear to 
      offer a superior option for predictive evaluation of dengue transmission risk and 
      anticipating the potential for outbreaks.

TI  - Comparative study on infection-induced thrombocytopenia among returned travellers.
PG  - 373-9
LID - 10.1007/s15010-012-0242-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia is a frequent finding among ill returned travellers and 
      may be caused by a large number of different conditions, including infectious 
      diseases specific or typical for tropical and subtropical regions. In order to 
      assess the diagnostic significance of thrombocytopenia we investigated a large 
      cohort of returned travellers. METHODS: This was a comparative study in which data 
      collected on 19,473 returned travellers who consulted the outpatient travel clinic 
      of the the University of Munich Hospital between 1999 and 2009 were analysed. Of 
      these, 732 (3.8%) travellers were diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, and their data 
      were compared with those of the remaining 18,741 travellers with normal platelet 
      counts. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia was significantly more frequent among patients 
      with malaria (63%), acute human immunodeficiency virus infection (48%), dengue 
      fever/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF; 47%), Epstein-Barr virus infectious 
      mononucleosis (23%), paratyphoid/typhoid fever (14%), and rickettsiosis (12%). 
      Malaria and DF/DHF caused 25% of all cases of thrombocytopenia (platelet count 
      <140,000/μl) and 75% of all cases of severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count 
      <30,000/μl). Sex, age, country of origin, duration and type of travel were not 
      significantly correlated with thrombocytopenia. The most frequent travel 
      destinations were Asia (42%), Africa (33%), and Latin America (14%). Travellers to 
      Sub-Saharan Africa (high risk for malaria) and to South/South-east Asia (high risk 
      for DF/DHF) had the highest relative risk for thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: Platelet 
      count among returned travellers is an essential screening parameter, as 
      thrombocytopenia is highly correlated with important infectious diseases, 
      particularly with malaria and DF/DHF.

TI  - Community-based control of Aedes aegypti by using Mesocyclops in southern Vietnam.
PG  - 850-859
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0466 [doi]
AB  - We previously reported a new community-based mosquito control strategy that resulted 
      in elimination of Aedes aegypti (Linn.) in 40 of 46 communes in northern and central 
      Vietnam, and with annual recurrent total costs (direct and indirect) of only 
      $0.28-$0.89 international dollars per person. This control strategy was extended to 
      four provinces in southern Vietnam in Long An and Hau Giang (2004-2007) and to Long 
      An, Ben Tre, and Vinh Long (2005-2010). In a total of 14 communes with 124,743 
      residents, the mean ± SD of adult female Ae. aegypti was reduced from 0.93 ± 0.62 to 
      0.06 ± 0.09, and the reduction of immature Ae. aegypti averaged 98.8%. By the final 
      survey, no adults could be collected in 6 of 14 communes, and one commune, Binh 
      Thanh, also had no immature forms. Although the community-based programs also 
      involved community education and clean-up campaigns, the prevalence of Mesocyclops 
      in large water storage containers > 50 liters increased from 12.77 ± 8.39 to 75.69 ± 
      9.17% over periods of 15-45 months. At the conclusion of the study, no confirmed 
      dengue cases were detected in four of the five communes for which diagnostic 
      serologic analysis was performed. The rate of progress was faster in communes that 
      were added in stages to the program but the reason for this finding was unclear. At 
      the completion of the formal project, sustainability funds were set up to provide 
      each commune with the financial means to ensure that community-based dengue control 
      activities continued.

AB  - Postoperative hemorrhage is one of the few serious complications that can occur as a 
      result of dental procedures. We report a case of an elderly patient with 
      postextraction bleeding caused by dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Although a major 
      sequel of DHF is bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia, prolonged hemorrhage as a 
      result of extraction of tooth has not been reported. In the current scenario of 
      emerging and reemerging infections worldwide, dengue is gaining global prominence. 
      This case documents the course and progression of this disease from a dental 
      perspective and highlights the as yet unreported capacity of causing oral 
      complications after dental treatment.

PG  - e42771
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0042771 [doi]
LID - e42771
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease. In the 
      absence of specific drugs or vaccines, control focuses on suppressing the principal 
      mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, yet current methods have not proven adequate to 
      control the disease. New methods are therefore urgently needed, for example 
      genetics-based sterile-male-release methods. However, this requires that lab-reared, 
      modified mosquitoes be able to survive and disperse adequately in the field. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Adult male mosquitoes were released into an 
      uninhabited forested area of Pahang, Malaysia. Their survival and dispersal was 
      assessed by use of a network of traps. Two strains were used, an engineered 
      'genetically sterile' (OX513A) and a wild-type laboratory strain, to give both 
      absolute and relative data about the performance of the modified mosquitoes. The two 
      strains had similar maximum dispersal distances (220 m), but mean distance travelled 
      of the OX513A strain was lower (52 vs. 100 m). Life expectancy was similar (2.0 vs. 
      2.2 days). Recapture rates were high for both strains, possibly because of the 
      uninhabited nature of the site. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: After extensive contained 
      studies and regulatory scrutiny, a field release of engineered mosquitoes was safely 
      and successfully conducted in Malaysia. The engineered strain showed similar field 
      longevity to an unmodified counterpart, though in this setting dispersal was reduced 
      relative to the unmodified strain. These data are encouraging for the future testing 
      and implementation of genetic control strategies and will help guide future field 
      use of this and other engineered strains.

TI  - The efficacy of a chitin synthesis inhibitor against field populations of 
      organophosphate-resistant Aedes aegypti in Brazil.
PG  - 387-95
LID - S0074-02762012000300014 [pii]
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the main focus of dengue control campaigns. Because of 
      widespread resistance against conventional chemical insecticides, chitin synthesis 
      inhibitors (CSIs) are considered control alternatives. We evaluated the resistance 
      status of four Brazilian Ae. aegypti populations to both the organophosphate 
      temephos and the pyrethroid deltamethrin, which are used in Brazil to control larvae 
      and adults, respectively. All vector populations exhibited high levels of temephos 
      resistance and varying rates of alterations in their susceptibility to pyrethroids. 
      The effect of the CSI novaluron on these populations was also investigated. 
      Novaluron was effective against all populations under laboratory conditions. 
      Field-simulated assays with partial water replacement were conducted to evaluate 
      novaluron persistence. Bioassays were continued until an adult emergence inhibition 
      of at least 70% was attained. We found a residual effect of eight weeks under indoor 
      conditions and novaluron persisted for five-six weeks in assays conducted in an 
      external area. Our data show that novaluron is effective against the Ae. aegypti 
      populations tested, regardless of their resistance to conventional chemical 
      insecticides.

TI  - Enhancement of the detection limit for lateral flow immunoassays: evaluation and 
      comparison of bioconjugates.
PG  - 264-70
LID - 10.1016/j.jim.2011.11.003 [doi]
AB  - There is an increasing demand for convenient and accurate point-of-care tools that 
      can detect and diagnose different stages of a disease in remote or impoverished 
      settings. In recent years, lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) have been indicated as a 
      suitable medical diagnostic tool for these environments because they require little 
      or no sample preparation, provide rapid and reliable results with no electronic 
      components and thus can be manufactured at low costs and operated by unskilled 
      personnel. However, even though they have been successfully applied to acute and 
      chronic disease detection, LFIA based on gold nanoparticles, the standard marker, 
      show serious limitations when high sensitivity is needed, such as early stage 
      disease detection. Moreover, based on the lack of comparative information for label 
      performance, significant optimization of the systems that are currently in use might 
      be possible. To this end, in the presented work, we compare the detection limit 
      between the four most used labels: colloidal-gold, silver enhanced gold, blue latex 
      bead and carbon black nanoparticles. Preliminary results were obtained by using the 
      biotin-streptavidin coupling as a model system and showed that carbon black had a 
      remarkably low detection limit of 0.01 μg/mL in comparison to 0.1 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL and 
      1mg/mL for silver-coated gold nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles and polystyrene 
      beads, respectively. Therefore, as a proof of concept, carbon black was used in a 
      detection system for Dengue fever. This was achieved by immobilizing monoclonal 
      antibodies for the nonstructural glycoprotein (NS1) of the Dengue virus to carbon 
      black. We found that the colorimetric detection limit of 57 ng/mL for carbon black 
      was ten times lower than the 575 ng/mL observed for standard gold nanoparticles; 
      which makes it sensitive enough to diagnose a patient on the first days of 
      infection. We therefore conclude that, careful screening of detection labels should 
      be performed as a necessary step during LFIA development in order to enhance the 
      detection limit in a final test system.

      Queensland: an exploratory study.
PG  - 166-71
LID - 10.1071/PY11039 [doi]
AB  - In north Queensland, recurring epidemics of dengue fever are a public health 
      concern. Each epidemic is initiated by an index case: an infected person arriving 
      from an endemic country or region with dengue activity who then transmits the 
      disease to local mosquitoes. A timely diagnosis of dengue in an index case and 
      notification to public health services is essential to prevent epidemics. This 
      qualitative study explores north Queensland general practitioners' experiences and 
      patterns of treatment of febrile travellers. Individual, semi-structured interviews 
      with 50 general practitioners working in north Queensland were conducted. Analysis 
      of the data resulted in four themes for discussion: characteristics of febrile 
      travellers presenting to local general practitioners, the cost of pathology tests as 
      a barrier to diagnosis, appropriate pathology testing, and notifying tropical public 
      health services. Recommendations from this study point to a need for ongoing 
      education and training for general practitioners in best practice with regards 
      pathology testing for suspected dengue fever cases. As well, there is a need to 
      provide clearer guidelines to general practitioners on when to notify tropical 
      public health services of suspicious diagnoses of dengue.

TI  - Changing domesticity of Aedes aegypti in northern peninsular Malaysia: reproductive 
      consequences and potential epidemiological implications.

LID - e30919
AB  - BACKGROUND: The domestic dengue vector Aedes aegypti mosquitoes breed in indoor 
      containers. However, in northern peninsular Malaysia, they show equal preference for 
      breeding in both indoor and outdoor habitats. To evaluate the epidemiological 
      implications of this peridomestic adaptation, we examined whether Ae. aegypti 
      exhibits decreased survival, gonotrophic activity, and fecundity due to lack of host 
      availability and the changing breeding behavior. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 
      This yearlong field surveillance identified Ae. aegypti breeding in outdoor 
      containers on an enormous scale. Through a sequence of experiments incorporating 
      outdoors and indoors adapting as well as adapted populations, we observed that 
      indoors provided better environment for the survival of Ae. aegypti and the observed 
      death patterns could be explained on the basis of a difference in body size. The 
      duration of gonotrophic period was much shorter in large-bodied females. Fecundity 
      tended to be greater in indoor acclimated females. We also found increased tendency 
      to multiple feeding in outdoors adapted females, which were smaller in size compared 
      to their outdoors breeding counterparts. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The data presented 
      here suggest that acclimatization of Ae. aegypti to the outdoor environment may not 
      decrease its lifespan or gonotrophic activity but rather increase breeding 
      opportunities (increased number of discarded containers outdoors), the rate of 
      larval development, but small body sizes at emergence. Size is likely to be 
      correlated with disease transmission. In general, small size in Aedes females will 
      favor increased blood-feeding frequency resulting in higher population sizes and 
      disease occurrence.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue fever (DF), a mosquito-borne 
      illness endemic to tropical and subtropical regions. There is currently no effective 
      drug or vaccine formulation for the prevention of DF and its more severe forms, 
      i.e., dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). There are two 
      generally available experimental models for the study of DENV pathogenicity as well 
      as the evaluation of potential vaccine candidates. The first model consists of 
      non-human primates, which do not develop symptoms but rather a transient viremia. 
      Second, mouse-adapted virus strains or immunocompromised mouse lineages are 
      utilized, which display some of the pathological features of the infection observed 
      in humans but may not be relevant to the results with regard to the wild-type 
      original virus strains or mouse lineages. In this study, we describe a genetic and 
      pathological study of a DENV2 clinical isolate, named JHA1, which is naturally 
      capable of infecting and killing Balb/c mice and reproduces some of the symptoms 
      observed in DENV-infected subjects. Sequence analyses demonstrated that the JHA1 
      isolate belongs to the American genotype group and carries genetic markers 
      previously associated with neurovirulence in mouse-adapted virus strains. The JHA1 
      strain was lethal to immunocompetent mice following intracranial (i.c.) inoculation 
      with a LD(50) of approximately 50 PFU. Mice infected with the JHA1 strain lost 
      weight and exhibited general tissue damage and hematological disturbances, with 
      similarity to those symptoms observed in infected humans. In addition, it was 
      demonstrated that the JHA1 strain shares immunological determinants with the DENV2 
      NGC reference strain, as evaluated by cross-reactivity of anti-envelope glycoprotein 
      (domain III) antibodies. The present results indicate that the JHA1 isolate may be a 
      useful tool in the study of DENV pathogenicity and will help in the evaluation of 
      anti-DENV vaccine formulations as well as potential therapeutic approaches.

AB  - There are few animal models of dengue infection, especially in immunocompetent mice. 
      Here, we describe alterations found in adult immunocompetent mice inoculated with an 
      adapted Dengue virus (DENV-3) strain. Infection of mice with the adapted DENV-3 
      caused inoculum-dependent lethality that was preceded by several hematological and 
      biochemical changes and increased virus dissemination, features consistent with 
      severe disease manifestation in humans. IFN-γ expression increased after DENV-3 
      infection of WT mice and this was preceded by increase in expression of IL-12 and 
      IL-18. In DENV-3-inoculated IFN-γ(-/-) mice, there was enhanced lethality, which was 
      preceded by severe disease manifestation and virus replication. Lack of IFN-γ 
      production was associated with diminished NO-synthase 2 (NOS2) expression and higher 
      susceptibility of NOS2(-/-) mice to DENV-3 infection. Therefore, mechanisms of 
      protection to DENV-3 infection rely on IFN-γ-NOS2-NO-dependent control of viral 
      replication and of disease severity, a pathway showed to be relevant for resistance 
      to DENV infection in other experimental and clinical settings. Thus, the model of 
      DENV-3 infection in immunocompetent mice described here represents a significant 
      advance in animal models of severe dengue disease and may provide an important tool 
      to the elucidation of immunopathogenesis of disease and of protective mechanisms 
      associated with infection.

TI  - Phylogeography of Aedes aegypti in Argentina: long-distance colonization and rapid 
      restoration of fragmented relicts after a continental control campaign.
PG  - 254-61
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2011.0696 [doi]
AB  - Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti, the main vector of Dengue and Yellow Fever viruses, is 
      present in all the northern and central provinces of Argentina. During 2009, a 
      Dengue outbreak spread broadly throughout the country, causing 27,752 infections in 
      13 provinces. In Argentina, little is known about the demographic history of this 
      vector, which suffered a drastic decrease in abundance and distribution during a 
      major control campaign performed in the Americas between 1950 and 1960. With the aim 
      of uncovering the past and present events that determined the present distribution 
      of the genetic variability in Ae. aegypti populations, we analyzed the distribution 
      and abundance of mitochondrial haplotypes obtained by sequencing a 450-bp fragment 
      of the ND5 gene. We detected 14 haplotypes among the sequences of 197 individuals 
      from 22 populations that cover most of the distribution of the species in Argentina; 
      one population from Bolivia and one from Paraguay were also included. A high 
      heterogeneity in the geographical distribution of the genetic polymorphism was 
      observed, with a pattern of isolation by distance in the north-west of Argentina. 
      Haplotypes nested in three haplogroups, representing different colonization events 
      and evolutionary histories in distant geographical areas. North-western and 
      north-eastern populations correspond to independent introduced stocks for which a 
      past fragmentation and rapid restoration from highly polymorphic relicts were 
      inferred. By contrast, a unique genetic variant was detected in the east, probably 
      as the result of a recent re-colonization event after the major control campaign; in 
      this area, the mosquito would have been practically eradicated as a consequence of 
      the continental control campaign.

AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the survival of Gambusia holbrooki 
      (Cyprinodontiformes: Poeciliidae) fishin domestic containers in Jeddah, as well as 
      its effectiveness in the control of immature A.aegypti. The use of G. holbrooki 
      compared to Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (B.t.i.)was donein domestic 
      containers. In a first home visit, G. holbrooki or B.t.i were applied to water 
      containers. Two follow-up visits were conducted after 3-4 & 5-6 months to assess the 
      presence of viable fish in the containers and infestation by larvae. G. holbrooki 
      fish were still present in 97.6% of containers 45-60 days after application. The 
      infestation rate was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the B.t.i group (IR 
      ratio=21.60, 95% CI: 6.46-72.28). In deposits where the fish remained, efficacy was 
      85% better than B.t.i. The permanence of fish was higher in concrete tanks (48.5%) 
      located outside the house (47.5%) and at ground level (53.3%).

TI  - Household survey of container-breeding mosquitoes and climatic factors influencing 
      the prevalence of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in Makkah City, Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 849-57

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of container breeding mosquitoes with 
      emphasis on the seasonality and larval habitats of Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) in 
      Makkah City, adjoining an environmental monitoring and dengue incidence. METHODS: 
      Monthly visits were performed between April 2008 and March 2009 to randomly selected 
      houses. During each visit, mosquito larvae were collected from indoors and outdoors 
      containers by either dipping or pipetting. Mosquitoes were morphologically 
      identified. Data on temperature, relative humidity, rain/precipitations during the 
      survey period was retrieved from governmental sources and analyzed. RESULTS: The 
      city was warmer in dry season (DS) than wet season (WS). No rain occurred at all 
      during DS and even precipitations did fall, wetting events were much greater during 
      WS. Larval survey revealed the co-breeding of Aedes, Culex and Anopheles in a 
      variety of artificial containers in and around homes. 32 109 larvae representing 1st 
      , 2nd, 3rd, and 4th stages were collected from 22 618 container habitats. Culicines 
      was far the commonest and Aedes genus was as numerous as the Culex population. Ae. 
      aegypti larval abundance exhibited marked temporal variations, overall, being 
      usually more abundant during WS. Ten types of artificial containers were found with 
      developing larvae. 70% of these habitats were located indoors. 71.42% of indoor 
      containers were permanent and 28.58% was semi-permanent during WS. Cement tanks was 
      the only container type permanent during DS. Ae. aegypti larval indices (CI, HI, BI) 
      recorded were greater during WS. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate 
      a high risk of dengue transmission in the holy city.

TI  - Resistance of Aedes aegypti (L.) larvae to temephos in Surabaya, Indonesia.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - The resistance of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to insecticides threatens dengue virus 
      control efforts. In this study, Ae. aegypti larvae collected from 12 subdistricts in 
      Surabaya, Indonesia, where dengue is endemic, were tested for resistance to the 
      organophosphate, temephos. Susceptibility testing, performed according to World 
      Health Organization (WHO) methods, showed all field strains were resistant to 
      temephos at a dose of 0.012 mg/l, with mortality rates at 24 hours of 22% to 60%. 
      Another susceptibility test to determine median lethal time (LT50) indicates 
      resistance ratios ranging from 2.2 to 8.5. Although incipient resistance was 
      detected at a dosage of 1 mg/l, as determined by the LT50, mortalities higher than 
      80% within 24 hours were detected using the WHO method in nine subdistricts of 
      Surabaya, indicating temephos at 1 mg/l is still effective in field conditions in 
      these areas. In three subdistricts (Tambaksari, Gubeng and Sawahan), the mortality 
      rates were under 80%, indicating possible resistance to temephos.

PG  - 652-7
AB  - To investigate the effects of DENV infection on the expression of Vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in monocytes, and to explore which innate immune 
      signaling pathway is responsible for VEGF induction. Real-time PCR was used to 
      determine the expression levels of VEGF in DENV-infected THP-1. We found that 
      different serotype viruses (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3) induced the VEGF expression. 
      Moreover, VEGF expression was significantly increased in human primary monocytes 
      infected with DENV 2. In addition, VEGF induction by DENV2 was significantly 
      impaired by knockdown of TLR3 and interferon-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), or 
      by inhibition of ERK, JNK or NF-kappaB. These results demonstrated that DENV induced 
      VEGF expression in monocytes, and the activation of TLR3, IPS-1 signal pathways were 
      required for DENV2-triggered VEGF induction, suggesting that VEGF might be a 
      promising therapeutic target for DHF.

AB  - Dengue fever has been a major problem in hospital settings in Brazil for the past 15 
      years. The main concern has been the severe forms, i.e., dengue hemorrhagic fever 
      and dengue shock syndrome. Hemorrhagic events of different degrees have also been a 
      major concern. We report five cases of large vein thrombotic events associated with 
      the acute phase of dengue fever, including a previously non-reported case of 
      mesenteric vein thrombosis. Complications such as these could have been overlooked 
      in the diagnosis of dengue fever, given that the major concern is the hemorrhagic 
      event.

AB  - Following successive outbreaks of dengue fever caused predominantly by dengue virus 
      (DENV) 2 and 3, DENV-1 is now the primary serotype circulating in Brazil. We 
      sequenced and analyzed Brazilian DENV-1 genomes and found that all isolates belong 
      to genotype V and are subdivided into three lineages, which were introduced during 
      four different events. The first introduction occurred in 1984-85, the second in 
      1997-99, and the third and fourth occurred from 2004 to 2007. These events were 
      associated with an increase in genetic diversity but not with positive selection. 
      Moreover, a potential new recombinant strain derived from two distinct lineages was 
      detected. We demonstrate that the dynamics of DENV-1 in Brazil is characterized by 
      introduction, movement, local evolution, and lineage replacement. This study 
      strengthens the relevance of genotype surveillance in order to identify, trace, and 
      control virus populations circulating in Brazil and Latin America.

TI  - [Classification of dengue hemorrhagic fever using decision trees in the early phase 
      of the disease].
PG  - 35-42
AB  - INTRODUCTION: dengue is a viral disease with endemic behavior. At the beginning of 
      the illness it is not possible to know which patients will have an unfavorable 
      evolution and develop a severe form of dengue. However, some warning symptoms and 
      signs may be present. OBJECTIVE: to apply decision tree techniques to the 
      exploration of signs of severity in the early phase of the illness. METHODS: the 
      study sample was made up of 230 patients admitted with dengue to "Pedro Kouri" 
      Institute of Tropical Medicine in 2001. The variables considered for the 
      classification were the signs, symptoms and laboratory exams on the third day of 
      evolution of the illness. The algorithm of classification and regression trees using 
      the Gini's index was applied. Different loss matrices to improve the sensitivity 
      were considered. RESULTS: the algorithm CART, corresponding to the best loss, had a 
      sensitivity of 98,68% and global error of 0,36. Without considering loss, it 
      obtained its sensitivity reached 74% with an error of 0,25. In both cases, the most 
      important variables were platelets and hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: the study submitted 
      rules of decision with high sensitivity and negative predictive value of utility in 
      the clinical practice. The laboratory variables resulted more important from the 
      informational viewpoint than the clinical ones to discriminate clinical forms of 
      dengue.

TI  - Cost of production of live attenuated dengue vaccines: a case study of the Instituto 
      Butantan, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
PG  - 4892-6
LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.02.064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A vaccine to prevent dengue disease is urgently needed. Fortunately, a 
      few tetravalent candidate vaccines are in the later stages of development and show 
      promise. But, if the cost of these candidates is too high, their beneficial 
      potential will not be realized. The price of a vaccine is one of the most important 
      factors affecting its ultimate application in developing countries. In recent years, 
      new vaccines such as those for human papilloma virus and pneumococcal disease 
      (conjugate vaccine) have been introduced with prices in developed countries 
      exceeding $50 per dose. These prices are above the level affordable by developing 
      countries. In contrast, other vaccines such as those against Japanese encephalitis 
      (SA14-14-2 strain vaccine) and meningitis type A have prices in developing countries 
      below one dollar per dose, and it is expected that their introduction and use will 
      proceed more rapidly. Because dengue disease is caused by four related viruses, 
      vaccines must be able to protect against all four. Although there are several live 
      attenuated dengue vaccine candidates under clinical evaluation, there remains 
      uncertainty about the cost of production of these tetravalent vaccines, and this 
      uncertainty is an impediment to rapid progress in planning for the introduction and 
      distribution of dengue vaccines once they are licensed. METHOD: We have undertaken a 
      detailed economic analysis, using standard industrial methodologies and applying 
      generally accepted accounting practices, of the cost of production of a live 
      attenuated vaccine, originally developed at the US National Institutes of Health 
      (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases), to be produced at the 
      Instituto Butantan in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We determined direct costs of materials, 
      direct costs of personnel and labor, indirect costs, and depreciation. These were 
      analyzed assuming a steady-state production of 60 million doses per year. RESULTS: 
      Although this study does not seek to compute the price of the final licensed 
      vaccine, the cost of production estimate produced here leads to the conclusion that 
      the vaccine can be made available at a price that most ministries of health in 
      developing countries could afford. This conclusion provides strong encouragement for 
      supporting the development of the vaccine so that, if it proves to be safe and 
      effective, licensure can be achieved soon and the burden of dengue disease can be 
      reduced.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to field test dengue vaccines to determine their 
      role in the control of the disease. Our aims were to study dengue epidemiology and 
      prepare the site for a dengue vaccine efficacy trial. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We 
      performed a prospective cohort study of children in primary schools in central 
      Thailand from 2006 through 2009. We assessed the epidemiology of dengue by active 
      fever surveillance for acute febrile illness as detected by school absenteeism and 
      telephone contact of parents, and dengue diagnostic testing. Dengue accounted for 
      394 (6.74%) of the 5,842 febrile cases identified in 2882, 3104, 2717 and 2312 
      student person-years over the four years, respectively. Dengue incidence was 1.77% 
      in 2006, 3.58% in 2007, 5.74% in 2008 and 3.29% in 2009. Mean dengue incidence over 
      the 4 years was 3.6%. Dengue virus (DENV) types were determined in 333 (84.5%) of 
      positive specimens; DENV serotype 1 (DENV-1) was the most common (43%), followed by 
      DENV-2 (29%), DENV-3 (20%) and DENV-4 (8%). Disease severity ranged from dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in 42 (10.5%) cases, dengue fever (DF) in 142 (35.5%) cases 
      and undifferentiated fever (UF) in 210 (52.5%) cases. All four DENV serotypes were 
      involved in all disease severity. A majority of cases had secondary DENV infection, 
      95% in DHF, 88.7% in DF and 81.9% in UF. Two DHF (0.5%) cases had primary DENV-3 
      infection. CONCLUSION: The results illustrate the high incidence of dengue with all 
      four DENV serotypes in primary school children, with approximately 50% of disease 
      manifesting as mild clinical symptoms of UF, not meeting the 1997 WHO criteria for 
      dengue. Severe disease (DHF) occurred in one tenth of cases. Data of this type are 
      required for clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of dengue vaccines in large 
      scale clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop diagnostic test for detection chikungunya virus (CHIKV and 
      Dengue virus (DENV) infection. METHODS: We have performed a rapid, accurate 
      laboratory confirmative method to simultaneously detect, quantify and differentiate 
      CHIKV and DENV infection by single-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: The 
      assay's sensitivity was 97.65%, specificity was 92.59% and accuracy was 95.82% when 
      compared to conventional RT-PCR. Additionally, there was no cross-reaction between 
      CHIKV, DENV, Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis C, hepatitis A or hepatitis E 
      virus. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid and reliable assay provides a means for simultaneous 
      early diagnosis of CHIKV and DENV in a single-step reaction.

TI  - Interpretation of the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies in a rapid test for dengue: 
      analysis of dengue antibody prevalence in Fortaleza City in the 20th year of the 
      epidemic.
PG  - 163-7
LID - S0037-86822012000200005 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of dengue and the differentiation between primary and 
      secondary infections are important for monitoring the spread of the epidemic and 
      identifying the risk of severe forms of the disease. The detection of immunoglobulin 
      (Ig)M and IgG antibodies is the main technique for the laboratory diagnosis of 
      dengue. The present study assessed the application of a rapid test for dengue 
      concerning detection of new cases, reinfection recognition, and estimation of the 
      epidemic attack rate. METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional, 
      descriptive study on dengue using the Fortaleza Health Municipal Department 
      database. The results from 1,530 tested samples, from 2005-2006, were compared with 
      data from epidemiological studies of dengue outbreaks in 1996, 2003, and 2010. 
      RESULTS: The rapid test confirmed 52% recent infections in the tested patients with 
      clinical suspicion of dengue: 40% detected using IgM and 12% of new cases using IgG 
      in the non-reactive IgM results. The positive IgM plus negative IgG (IgM+ plus IgG-) 
      results showed that 38% of those patients had a recent primary dengue infection, 
      while the positive IgG plus either positive or negative IgM (IgG+ plus IgM+/-) 
      results indicated that 62% had dengue for at least a second time (recent secondary 
      infections). This proportion of reinfections permitted us to estimate the attack 
      rate as >62% of the population sample. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid test for dengue has 
      enhanced our ability to detect new infections and to characterize them into primary 
      and secondary infections, permitting the estimation of the minimal attack rate for a 
      population during an outbreak.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is an emerging health problem in several coastlines along the Red 
      Sea. The objective of the present work is to elucidate spatial and temporal patterns 
      of dengue transmission in Port Sudan. METHODS/FINDINGS: A longitudinal study with 
      three cross-sectional surveys was carried out in upper, middle and lower class 
      neighborhoods, from November 2008 to October 2009. Monthly, entomological surveys 
      were followed by serological surveys in dengue vector-positive houses. 
      Meteorological records were obtained from two weather stations in the city during 
      the same time. Overall, 2825 houses were inspected. Aedes aegypti represented 65% 
      (35,714/54,944) and 68% (2526/3715) of the collected larvae and pupae, respectively. 
      Out of 4640 drinking water containers, 2297 were positive for Ae. aegypti. Clay-pots 
      "Zeirr" followed by plastic barrels were key productive containers for pupae of 
      dengue vector, 63% (n = 3959) and 26% (n = 1651), respectively. A total of 791 blood 
      samples were tested using PanBio Capture/Indirect IgM ELISA. Overall, the 
      sero-prevalence rate of dengue ranged between 3%-8% (41/791), compared to an 
      incidence of 29-40 new cases per 10,000 (193/54886) in the same examined population. 
      Lower and middle class neighborhoods had higher entomological indices compared with 
      upper class ones (p<0.001). Although, dengue incidence rate was significantly lower 
      in the middle and lower class neighborhoods (F = 73.97, d.f. = 2, p<0.001), no 
      difference in IgM prevalence was shown. The city is subject to two transmission 
      peaks in the winter (i.e. November-January), and summer (i.e. June-August). The 
      serological peaks of dengue are preceded by entomological peaks that occur before 
      the onset of winter (November) and summer (March) respectively. CONCLUSION: Dengue 
      incidence is heterogeneously distributed across the neighborhoods of Port Sudan and 
      exhibits a bi-cyclic intra-annual pattern. Hence, it should be feasible to carry out 
      timely vector control measures to prevent or reduce dengue transmission.

LID - 10.1128/AAC.01554-12 [doi]
AB  - A key challenge faced by promising antiviral drugs, such as iminosugars, is in vivo 
      delivery to achieve effective levels of drug without toxicity. Four iminosugars, all 
      deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) derivatives-N-butyl DNJ (NB-DNJ), N-nonyl DNJ, 
      N-(9-methoxynonyl) DNJ, and N-(6'-[4″-azido-2″-nitrophenylamino]hexyl)-1-DNJ 
      (NAP-DNJ)-potently inhibited both the percentage of cells infected with dengue virus 
      and release of infectious virus from primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, 
      demonstrating their efficacy in primary cells. In a lethal antibody-dependent 
      enhancement mouse model of dengue pathogenesis, free NB-DNJ significantly enhanced 
      survival and lowered viral load in organs and serum. Liposome-mediated delivery of 
      NB-DNJ, in comparison with free NB-DNJ, resulted in a 3-log(10) reduction in the 
      dose of drug sufficient to enhance animal survival. The optimizing of the effective 
      dose in this way could liberate the therapeutic potential of many cytotoxic 
      antivirals against both dengue virus and a wide array of other viruses.

TI  - Changing haematological parameters in dengue viral infections.
PG  - 3-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue Fever is the most common arboviral disease in the world, and 
      presents cyclically in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The four 
      serotypes of dengue virus, 1, 2, 3, and 4, form an antigenic subgroup of the 
      flaviviruses (Group B arboviruses). Transmission to humans of any of these serotypes 
      initiates a spectrum of host responses, from in apparent to severe and sometimes 
      lethal infections. Complete Blood count (CBC) is an important part of the diagnostic 
      workup of patients. Comparison of various finding in CBC including peripheral smear 
      can help the physician in better management of the patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      This cross sectional study was carried out on a series of suspected patients of 
      Dengue viral infection reporting in Ittefaq Hospital (Trust). All were investigated 
      for serological markers of acute infection. RESULTS: Out of 341 acute cases 166 
      (48.7%) were confirmed by IgM against Dengue virus. IgG anti-dengue was used on 200 
      suspected re-infected patients. Seventy-one (39.5%) were positive and 118 (59%) were 
      negative. Among 245 confirmed dengue fever patients 43 (17.6%) were considered 
      having dengue hemorrhagic fever on the basis of lab and clinical findings. Raised 
      haematocrit, Leukopenia with relative Lymphocytosis and presence atypical 
      lymphocytes along with plasmacytoid cells was consistent finding at presentation in 
      both the patterns of disease, i.e., Dengue Haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and Dengue fever 
      (DF). CONCLUSION: Changes in relative percentage of cells appear with improvement in 
      the symptoms and recovery from the disease. These findings indicate that in the 
      course of the disease, there are major shifts within cellular component of blood.

TI  - Persistence of circulating memory B cell clones with potential for dengue virus 
      disease enhancement for decades following infection.
PG  - 2665-75
LID - 10.1128/JVI.06335-11 [doi]
AB  - Symptomatic dengue virus infection ranges in disease severity from an influenza-like 
      illness to life-threatening shock. One model of the mechanism underlying severe 
      disease proposes that weakly neutralizing, dengue serotype cross-reactive antibodies 
      induced during a primary infection facilitate virus entry into Fc receptor-bearing 
      cells during a subsequent secondary infection, increasing viral replication and the 
      release of cytokines and vasoactive mediators, culminating in shock. This process 
      has been termed antibody-dependent enhancement of infection and has significantly 
      hindered vaccine development. Much of our understanding of this process has come 
      from studies using mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs); however, antibody responses 
      in mice typically exhibit less complexity than those in humans. A better 
      understanding of the humoral immune response to natural dengue virus infection in 
      humans is sorely needed. Using a high-efficiency human hybridoma technology, we 
      isolated 37 hybridomas secreting human MAbs to dengue viruses from 12 subjects years 
      or even decades following primary or secondary infection. The majority of the human 
      antibodies recovered were broadly cross-reactive, directed against either envelope 
      or premembrane proteins, and capable of enhancement of infection in vitro; few 
      exhibited serotype-specific binding or potent neutralizing activity. Memory B cells 
      encoding enhancing antibodies predominated in the circulation, even two or more 
      decades following infection. Mapping the epitopes and activity of naturally 
      occurring dengue antibodies should prove valuable in determining whether the 
      enhancing and neutralizing activity of antibodies can be separated. Such principles 
      could be used in the rational design of vaccines that enhance the induction of 
      neutralizing antibodies, while lowering the risk of dengue shock syndrome.

TI  - Eco-bio-social research on dengue in Asia: a multicountry study on ecosystem and 
      community-based approaches for the control of dengue vectors in urban and peri-urban 
      Asia.
PG  - 428-35

AB  - This article provides an overview of methods and cross-site insights of a 5-year 
      research and capacity building initiative conducted between 2006 and 2011 in six 
      countries of South Asia (India, Sri Lanka) and South-East Asia (Indonesia, Myanmar, 
      Philippines, Thailand).The initiative managed an interdisciplinary investigation of 
      ecological, biological, and social (i.e., eco-bio-social) dimensions of dengue in 
      urban and peri-urban areas, and developed community-based interventions aimed at 
      reducing dengue vector breeding and viral transmission. The multicountry study 
      comprised interdisciplinary research groups from six leading Asian research 
      institutions. The groups conducted a detailed situation analysis to identify and 
      characterize local eco-bio-social conditions, and formed a community-of-practice for 
      EcoHealth research where group partners disseminated results and collaboratively 
      developed site-specific intervention tools for vector-borne diseases. In sites where 
      water containers produced more than 70% of Aedes pupae, interventions ranged from 
      mechanical lid covers for containers to biological control. Where small discarded 
      containers presented the main problem, groups experimented with solid waste 
      management, composting and recycling schemes. Many intervention tools were locally 
      produced and all tools were implemented through community partnership strategies. 
      All sites developed socially and culturally appropriate health education materials. 
      The study also mobilised and empowered women's, students' and community groups and 
      at several sites organized new volunteer groups for environmental health. The 
      initiative's programmes showed significant impact on vector densities in some sites. 
      Other sites showed varying effect - partially attributable to the 'contamination' of 
      control groups - yet led to significant outcomes at the community level where local 
      groups united around broad interests in environmental hygiene and sanitation. The 
      programme's findings are relevant for defining efficient, effective and ecologically 
      sound vector control interventions based on local evidence and in accordance with 
      WHO's strategy for integrated vector management.

TI  - Geographical gradient of mean age of dengue haemorrhagic fever patients in northern 
      Thailand.
PG  - 479-90
LID - 10.1017/S0950268811000653 [doi]
AB  - Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is caused by dengue virus transmitted by Aedes 
      mosquitoes; mean age of patients varies temporally and geographically. Variability 
      in age of patients may be due to differences in transmission intensity or 
      demographic structure. To compare these two hypotheses, the mean age of DHF patients 
      from 90 districts in northern Thailand (1994-1996, 2002-2004) was regressed against 
      (i) Aedes abundance or (ii) demographic variables (birthrate, average age) of the 
      district. We also developed software to quantify direction and strength of 
      geographical gradients of these variables. We found that, after adjusting for 
      socioeconomics, climate, spatial autocorrelation, the mean age of patients was 
      correlated only with Aedes abundance. The geographical gradient of mean age of 
      patients originated from entomological, climate, and socioeconomic gradients. Vector 
      abundance was a stronger determinant of mean age of patients than demographic 
      variables, in northern Thailand.

AB  - Symmetric peripheral gangrene is associated with a variety of infective and 
      non-infective etiologies. SPG is always presented with disseminated intravascular 
      coagulation (DIC) and carries a higher mortality. Herein, we describe a 42-year-old 
      female with dengue fever and rash developed bilateral symmetric dry gangrene of 2 nd 
      and 3 rd toes. There was no history of taking B-blockers, ergot etc. All the 
      peripheral pulses of the affected limbs were palpable. Color Doppler of lower limb 
      vessels was done, which indicated normal flow. Blood was positive for Fibrin 
      degradation products and D dimers. Patient was managed with IV fluids, LMWH, FFP 
      etc. Her general condition improved within 72 hours with no further progression of 
      gangrene.

LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.11.072 [doi]
AB  - Formulations of chimeric dengue vaccine (DENVax) viruses containing the pre-membrane 
      (prM) and envelope (E) genes of serotypes 1-4 expressed in the context of the 
      attenuated DENV-2 PDK-53 genome were tested for safety, immunogenicity and efficacy 
      in interferon receptor knock-out mice (AG129). Monovalent formulations were safe and 
      elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses to the homologous virus and only 
      limited cross-reactivity to other serotypes. A single dose of monovalent DENVax-1, 
      -2, or -3 vaccine provided eighty or greater percent protection against both 
      wild-type (wt) DENV-1 (Mochizuki strain) and DENV-2 (New Guinea C strain) challenge 
      viruses. A single dose of monovalent DENVax-4 also provided complete protection 
      against wt DENV-1 challenge and significantly increased the survival times after 
      challenge with wt DENV-2. In studies using tetravalent mixtures, DENVax ratios were 
      identified that: (i) caused limited viremia, (ii) induced serotype-specific 
      neutralizing antibodies to all four DENV serotypes with different hierarchies, and 
      (iii) conferred full protection against clinical signs of disease following 
      challenge with either wt DENV-1 or DENV-2 viruses. Overall, these data highlight the 
      immunogenic profile of DENVax, a novel candidate tetravalent dengue vaccine and the 
      advantage of sharing a common attenuated genomic backbone among the DENVax 
      monovalent vaccines that confer protection against homologous or heterologous virus 
      challenge.

TI  - Role of CD61+ cells in thrombocytopenia of dengue patients.
PG  - 600-10
LID - 10.1007/s12185-012-1175-x [doi]
AB  - Although hematological disorders with salient features of thrombocytopenia have been 
      well documented in dengue patients, the role of CD61-expressing platelets and the 
      megakaryocytic cell lineage in the pathogenesis of dengue virus (DENV) infection 
      remains largely unexplored. A prospective observational study was performed using 
      blood samples and PBMCs from dengue-confirmed patients, as well as from rhesus 
      monkeys (RM) experimentally infected with DENV. Immunohistochemical staining and 
      FACS techniques were applied to evaluate the frequencies of CD61(+) cells that 
      contained DENV antigen. Highly enriched population of CD61(+) cells was also 
      isolated from acute DENV-infected RM and assayed for DENV RNA by quantitative 
      RT-PCR. Results revealed that DENV antigen was found in small vesicles of varying 
      size, and more frequently in anucleated cells associated with platelets in dengue 
      patients. The DENV antigen-containing cells were CD61(+) and appeared to share 
      characteristics of megakaryocytes. Kinetic profiles of CD61(+) cells from 
      DENV-infected RM revealed a transient increase in CD61(+)CD62P(+) cells early after 
      DENV infection. DENV RNA in a highly enriched population of CD61(+) cells from the 
      infected RM was observed during acute stage. Our results indicate that virus 
      containing CD61(+) cells may be directly linked to the platelet dysfunction and low 
      platelet count characteristics of dengue patients.

      nephrolithotomy.
PG  - 177-9
LID - 10.1007/s00240-011-0394-6 [doi]
AB  - Post percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) bleeding is an uncommon yet serious 
      complication and is almost always related to a surgical cause. Nevertheless, medical 
      cause of bleeding is rarely encountered as a cause of this dangerous complication. 
      Dengue has been rarely reported as a cause of post operative bleeding. Bleeding 
      diathesis in dengue occurs not only due to thrombocytopenia but also due to 
      dysfunctional surviving platelets and increased fibrinolysis. We report a patient 
      who developed bleeding after an uneventful PNL due to dengue hemorrhagic fever. 
      Medical causes of bleeding such as locally endemic viral hemorrhagic fevers should 
      also be kept in mind and evaluated especially when a surgical cause of the bleed is 
      not found or suspected in bleeding after any surgery.

TI  - Severe falciparum malaria with dengue coinfection complicated by rhabdomyolysis and 
      acute kidney injury: an unusual case with myoglobinemia, myoglobinuria but normal 
      serum creatine kinase.
PG  - 364
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-12-364 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complication of severe malaria, and 
      rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria is an uncommon cause. We report an unusual case of 
      severe falciparum malaria with dengue coinfection complicated by AKI due to 
      myoglobinemia and myoglobinuria while maintaining a normal creatine kinase (CK). 
      CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year old Indonesian man presented with fever, chills, and 
      rigors with generalized myalgia and was diagnosed with falciparum malaria based on a 
      positive blood smear. This was complicated by rhabdomyolysis with raised serum and 
      urine myoglobin but normal CK. Despite rapid clearance of the parasitemia with 
      intravenous artesunate and aggressive hydration maintaining good urine output, his 
      myoglobinuria and acidosis worsened, progressing to uremia requiring renal 
      replacement therapy. High-flux hemodiafiltration effectively cleared his serum and 
      urine myoglobin with recovery of renal function. Further evaluation revealed 
      evidence of dengue coinfection and past infection with murine typhus. CONCLUSION: In 
      patients with severe falciparum malaria, the absence of raised CK alone does not 
      exclude a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. Raised serum and urine myoglobin levels could 
      lead to AKI and should be monitored. In the event of myoglobin-induced AKI requiring 
      dialysis, clinicians may consider using high-flux hemodiafiltration instead of 
      conventional hemodialysis for more effective myoglobin removal. In Southeast Asia, 
      potential endemic coinfections that can also cause or worsen rhabdomyolysis, such as 
      dengue, rickettsiosis and leptospirosis, should be considered.

TI  - Vector competence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) for 
      dengue virus in the Florida Keys.
PG  - 942-6
AB  - In 2009-2011, Monroe County in southern Florida experienced locally acquired and 
      traveler-imported focal dengue outbreaks. Aedes aegypti (L.) is the primary vector 
      of dengue virus (DENV) worldwide, is prevalent in Monroe County, and is the 
      suspected vector in Florida. Ae. albopictus (Skuse) is also known to be an important 
      vector of DENV and this species is ubiquitous in Florida; however, it is not yet 
      established in Monroe County. Florida Ae. aegypti (Key West and Stock Island 
      geographic colonies) and Ae. albopictus (Vero Beach geographic colony) were fed 
      blood containing 3.7 Log10 plaque-forming unit equivalents of DENV serotype 1 
      isolated from a patient involved in the Key West, FL, outbreak in 2010. Mosquitoes 
      were maintained at extrinsic incubation temperatures of 28 or 30 degrees C for an 
      incubation period of 14 d. Vector competence was assessed using rates of infection 
      (percent with virus-positive bodies), dissemination (percent infected with 
      virus-positive legs), and transmission (percent infected with virus-positive 
      saliva). No significant differences were observed in rates of infection or 
      dissemination between Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus at either extrinsic incubation 
      temperature. Transmission was observed only at 28 degrees C in both Ae. aegypti (Key 
      West) and Ae. albopictus. The assessment of local mosquito populations for their 
      DENV vector competence is essential and will aid mosquito control operators 
      interested in pinpointing specific vector populations for control. The extent to 
      which vector competence is affected by seasonal changes in temperature is discussed 
      and provides baseline risk assessment data to mosquito control agencies.

TI  - Early dengue virus protein synthesis induces extensive rearrangement of the 
      endoplasmic reticulum independent of the UPR and SREBP-2 pathway.
PG  - e38202

LID - e38202
AB  - The rearrangement of intracellular membranes has been long reported to be a common 
      feature in diseased cells. In this study, we used dengue virus (DENV) to study the 
      role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and 
      sterol-regulatory-element-binding-protein-2 (SREBP-2) pathway in the rearrangement 
      and expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) early after infection. Using laser 
      scanning confocal and differential interference contrast microscopy, we demonstrate 
      that rearrangement and expansion of the ER occurs early after DENV-2 infection. 
      Through the use of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells deficient in XBP1 and ATF6, we 
      show that ER rearrangement early after DENV infection is independent of the UPR. We 
      then demonstrate that enlargement of the ER is independent of the SREBP-2 activation 
      and upregulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme-A reductase, the 
      rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. We further show that 
      this ER rearrangement is not inhibited by the treatment of DENV-infected cells with 
      the cholesterol-inhibiting drug lovastatin. Using the transcription inhibitor 
      actinomycin D and the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide, we show that 
      de novo viral protein synthesis but not host transcription is necessary for 
      expansion and rearrangement of the ER. Lastly, we demonstrate that viral infection 
      induces the reabsorption of lipid droplets into the ER. Together, these results 
      demonstrate that modulation of intracellular membrane architecture of the cell early 
      after DENV-2 infection is driven by viral protein expression and does not require 
      the induction of the UPR and SREBP-2 pathways. This work paves the way for further 
      study of virally-induced membrane rearrangements and formation of cubic membranes.

TI  - Infectious diseases causing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in immunocompetent patients: 
      a state-of-the-art review.
PG  - 9-18
LID - 10.1007/s00408-012-9431-7 [doi]
AB  - Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) represents a syndrome that can complicate many 
      clinical conditions and may be life-threatening, requiring prompt treatment. It is 
      recognized by the signs of acute- or subacute-onset cough, hemoptysis, diffuse 
      radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, anemia, and hypoxemic respiratory distress. DAH 
      is characterized by the accumulation of intra-alveolar red blood cells originating 
      most frequently from the alveolar capillaries. It must be distinguished from 
      localized pulmonary hemorrhage, which is most commonly due to chronic bronchitis, 
      bronchiectasis, tumor, or localized infection. Hemoptysis, the major sign of DAH, 
      may develop suddenly or over a period of days to weeks; this sign may also be 
      initially absent, in which case diagnostic suspicion is established after sequential 
      bronchoalveolar lavage reveals worsening red blood cell counts. The causes of DAH 
      can be divided into infectious and noninfectious, the latter of which may affect 
      immunocompetent or immunodeficient patients. Pulmonary infections are rarely 
      reported in association with DAH, but they should be considered in the diagnostic 
      workup because of the obvious therapeutic implications. In immunocompromised 
      patients, the main infectious diseases that cause DAH are cytomegalovirus, 
      adenovirus, invasive aspergillosis, Mycoplasma, Legionella, and Strongyloides. In 
      immunocompetent patients, the infectious diseases that most frequently cause DAH are 
      influenza A (H1N1), dengue, leptospirosis, malaria, and Staphylococcus aureus 
      infection. Based on a search of the PubMed and Scopus databases, we review the 
      infectious diseases that may cause DAH in immunocompetent patients.

TI  - Dengue-1 virus clade replacement in Thailand associated with enhanced mosquito 
      transmission.
PG  - 1853-61
LID - 10.1128/JVI.06458-11 [doi]
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) are characterized by extensive genetic diversity and can be 
      organized in multiple, genetically distinct lineages that arise and die out on a 
      regular basis in regions where dengue is endemic. A fundamental question for 
      understanding DENV evolution is the relative extent to which stochastic processes 
      (genetic drift) and natural selection acting on fitness differences among lineages 
      contribute to lineage diversity and turnover. Here, we used a set of recently 
      collected and archived low-passage DENV-1 isolates from Thailand to examine the role 
      of mosquito vector-virus interactions in DENV evolution. By comparing the ability of 
      23 viruses isolated on different dates between 1985 and 2009 to be transmitted by a 
      present-day Aedes aegypti population from Thailand, we found that a major clade 
      replacement event in the mid-1990s was associated with virus isolates exhibiting 
      increased titers in the vector's hemocoel, which is predicted to result in a higher 
      probability of transmission. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that 
      selection for enhanced transmission by mosquitoes is a possible mechanism underlying 
      major DENV clade replacement events. There was significant variation in transmission 
      potential among isolates within each clade, indicating that in addition to 
      vector-driven selection, other evolutionary forces act to maintain viral genetic 
      diversity. We conclude that occasional adaptive processes involving the mosquito 
      vector can drive major DENV lineage replacement events.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated meteorological and demographic factors affecting 
      the length of dengue fever epidemics and the length of time between epidemics in 
      Barbados, Brazil, and Thailand. METHODS: Region-specific meteorological and 
      demographic data were collected for 104 sites from public sources. Fixed effects 
      piecewise logistic event history analysis was used to quantify the effects of 
      time-varying covariates on the duration of inter-epidemic spells and for the 
      duration of epidemics. RESULTS: Mean monthly temperature was the most important 
      factor affecting the duration of both inter-epidemic spells (β=0.543; confidence 
      interval (CI) 0.4954, 0.5906) and epidemic spells (β=-0.648; CI -0.7553, -0.5405). 
      Drought conditions increased the time between epidemics. Increased temperature 
      hastened the onset of an epidemic, and during an epidemic, higher mean temperature 
      increased the duration of the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: By using a duration analysis, 
      this study offers a novel approach for investigating the dynamics of dengue fever 
      epidemiology. Furthermore, these results offer new insights into prior findings of a 
      correlation between temperature and the geographic range and vector efficiency of 
      dengue fever.

AB  - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in 
      immunosuppressed persons. The incidence and association of CMV reactivation with 
      adverse clinical outcomes in critically ill persons lacking evidence of 
      immunosuppression at ICU admission has received great attention in the practice of 
      critical care medicine. Critically ill patients in ICU who had associated risk 
      factors such as mechanical ventilation, severe sepsis, or blood transfusion are more 
      prone to CMV activation, which in turn led to increased mortality and morbidity in 
      terms of increased ICU stay, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and higher 
      rates of nosocomial infections. However, severe CMV as initial presentation 
      mimicking dengue infection is rare. We recently came across seven cases with 
      positive CMV serology at ICU admission, which we discuss in the light of current 
      literature.

TI  - Characteristics and spectrum of disease among ill returned travelers from pre- and 
      post-earthquake Haiti: The GeoSentinel experience.
PG  - 23-8
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0430 [doi]
AB  - To describe patient characteristics and disease spectrum among foreign visitors to 
      Haiti before and after the 2010 earthquake, we used GeoSentinel Global Surveillance 
      Network data and compared 1 year post-earthquake versus 3 years pre-earthquake. 
      Post-earthquake travelers were younger, predominantly from the United States, more 
      frequently international assistance workers, and more often medically counseled 
      before their trip than pre-earthquake travelers. Work-related stress and upper 
      respiratory tract infections were more frequent post-earthquake; acute diarrhea, 
      dengue, and Plasmodium falciparum malaria were important contributors of morbidity 
      both pre- and post-earthquake. These data highlight the importance of providing 
      destination- and disaster-specific pre-travel counseling and post-travel evaluation 
      and medical management to persons traveling to or returning from a disaster 
      location, and evaluations should include attention to the psychological wellbeing of 
      these travelers. For travel to Haiti, focus should be on mosquito-borne illnesses 
      (dengue and P. falciparum malaria) and travelers' diarrhea.

AB  - We previously developed a panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against Dengue 
      virus (DENV)-1, of which few exhibited inhibitory activity against all DENV-1 
      genotypes. This finding is consistent with reports observing variable neutralization 
      of different DENV strains and genotypes using serum from individuals that 
      experienced natural infection or immunization. Herein, we describe the crystal 
      structures of DENV1-E111 bound to a novel CC' loop epitope on domain III (DIII) of 
      the E protein from two different DENV-1 genotypes. Docking of our structure onto the 
      available cryo-electron microscopy models of DENV virions revealed that the 
      DENV1-E111 epitope was inaccessible, suggesting that this antibody recognizes an 
      uncharacterized virus conformation. While the affinity of binding between DENV1-E111 
      and DIII varied by genotype, we observed limited correlation with inhibitory 
      activity. Instead, our results support the conclusion that potent neutralization 
      depends on genotype-dependent exposure of the CC' loop epitope. These findings 
      establish new structural complexity of the DENV virion, which may be relevant for 
      the choice of DENV strain for induction or analysis of neutralizing antibodies in 
      the context of vaccine development.

AB  - Prior to 2009 dengue fever had not been reported in the Andaman and Nicobar 
      archipelago. In 2009, a few patients with dengue fever-like illness were reported, 
      some of whom tested positive for dengue antibodies. In 2010, 516 suspected cases 
      were reported, including some with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock 
      syndrome (DSS); 80 (15·5%) were positive for dengue antibodies. DENV RNA was 
      detected in five patients and PCR-based typing showed that three of these belonged 
      to serotype 1 and two to serotype 2. This was confirmed by sequence typing. Two 
      clones of dengue virus, one belonging to serotype 1 and the other to serotype 2 
      appeared to be circulating in Andaman. Emergence of severe diseases such as DHF and 
      DSS might be due to recent introduction of a more virulent strain or because of the 
      enhancing effect of sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies developed due to prior 
      infections. There is a need to revise the vector-borne disease surveillance system 
      in the islands.

TI  - Aedes albopictus and the reemergence of Dengue.
PG  - 72
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-12-72 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a vector-borne disease that is estimated to affect millions of individuals 
      each year in tropical and subtropical areas, and it is reemerging in areas that have 
      been disease-free for relatively long periods of time. In this issue of the journal, 
      Peng et al. report on a Dengue outbreak in a city in southern China that had been 
      disease-free for more than two decades. The infection, which was due to serotype 1, 
      was introduced by a traveler from South-east Asia and transmitted by Aedes 
      albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito. Compared to Aedes aegypti, which is the most 
      important vector of Dengue, Ae albopictus is a less competent vector of arboviruses, 
      and the epidemics it causes are milder. However, Ae albopictus is becoming an 
      increasingly important vector because of its rapidly changing global distribution. 
      In particular, the worldwide trade in second hand tires, which often contain water 
      and are an ideal place for eggs and larvae, has been a key factor in the large-scale 
      conquest of Ae albopictus, which easily adapts to new environments, even in a 
      temperate climate. This expansion is creating new opportunities for viruses to 
      circulate in new areas, becoming a common cause of epidemics in Ae aegypti-free 
      countries, from Hawaii to Mauritius. The outbreak in China, like similar events, was 
      mild and short-lived. Because epidemics due to Ae albopictus are milder, the 
      replacement of Ae aegypti with the tiger mosquito could even result in public-health 
      benefits. However, there is no solid evidence of this, and the milder course of the 
      outbreak could be in part explained by the relatively short duration of the hot 
      season in some affected areas. Since it is almost impossible to prevent Ae 
      albopictus from being introduced in a country, mosquito-control measures at local 
      level remain the most effective means of controlling arbovirus outbreaks.

TI  - Alteration of cytokines and chemokines during febrile episodes associated with 
      endothelial cell damage and plasma leakage in dengue hemorrhagic fever.
PG  - e232-8
LID - 10.1097/INF.0b013e31826fd456 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The leakage of plasma during febrile episodes in dengue-infected 
      patients is a severe condition leading to dengue shock syndrome. Alteration of 
      cytokines/chemokines is suspected to be a major cause of endothelial cell damage in 
      these patients. The study was designed to demonstrate the alteration of cytokines 
      and chemokines in dengue-infected patients during febrile episodes. METHODS: The 
      blood samples from 164 patients with dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and 
      other febrile illnesses were collected daily from the day of hospitalization until 
      discharge and also in the convalescent stage. The levels of cytokines/chemokines 
      were determined using a sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay, and the hematological 
      parameters were examined by the ADVIA hematological analyzer. RESULTS: Two patterns 
      of cytokines/chemokines alteration were detected at different time points during the 
      febrile episode. The increased factors included interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-8, 
      IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 
      whereas IL-1β, IL-2, vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor 
      were decreased. Several cytokines were correlated with disease severity especially 
      in dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome patients. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      alteration in the cytokine/chemokine kinetics during a febrile episode can be used 
      as a predictor for severe dengue infection. The increased and decreased levels at 
      different time points can indicate the disease progression related to vascular 
      leakage in dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome patients.

TI  - Outbreak of dengue virus serotype-2 (DENV-2) of Cambodian origin in Manipur, India - 
      association with meteorological factors.
PG  - 649-55
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Dengue is a major health problem in many parts of India and 
      its neighbouring countries. Dengue cases have not been reported from Manipur, a 
      northeastern State of India till 2007. But, the sudden outbreak of fever with 
      febrile illness during 2007 and 2008, suspected to be dengue/dengue haemorrhagic 
      fever was investigated to detect the causative agent. Potential impact of climatic 
      variables on dengue transmission has been documented and hence the association 
      between climatic factors, entomological parameters and dengue cases was also 
      analysed. METHODS: Forty two and 16 blood samples were collected from patients 
      suspected to have dengue infection in the year 2007 and 2008, respectively. Viral 
      RNA was extracted from serum samples and subjected to multiplex one step RT-PCR 
      assay. Dengue specific amplicons were sequenced and phylogenetic analysis was 
      carried out. Multiyear trend analysis and 't' test were performed for the comparison 
      of different meteorological variables between the years 2000-2004 and 2005-2008. 
      RESULTS: The aetiological agent was found to be DENV-2 and the phylogenetic analysis 
      showed that the isolate was similar to that of Cambodian isolate. There was a 
      significant difference in minimum temperature (P<0.05), Relative humidity - morning 
      hours (P<0.001), relative humanity - afternoon hours (P<0.01) and cumulative 
      precipitation (P< 0.05) between the years 2000-2004 and 2005-2008. INTERPRETATION & 
      CONCLUSIONS: The sudden outbreak of dengue fever in Manipur State occurred was 
      possibly due to the increased temperature, relative humidity and decrease in 
      cumulative precipitation. These climatic factors would have contributed to the Aedes 
      mosquito abundance and increased virus transmission. Proper diseases surveillance 
      system integrated with meteorological warning system and management of vector 
      breeding sites will prevent such outbreaks in future.

TI  - Dengue and health care access: the role of social determinants of health in dengue 
      surveillance in Colombia.

AB  - Based on a first-hand experience from Colombia in the context of a local dengue 
      research project, this paper illustrates how social determinants of health are 
      associated with public health and how they can affect disease surveillance systems. 
      The paper shows how various issues related to dengue case notification procedures 
      and health insurance systems in Colombia are intertwined with more structural 
      socio-economic factors. We argue that there is a need for public health 
      interventions and health related research to acknowledge and consider the important 
      role social determinants play in public health dynamics.

TI  - Serum proteome and cytokine analysis in a longitudinal cohort of adults with primary 
      dengue infection reveals predictive markers of DHF.
PG  - e1887

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections caused by dengue virus are a major cause of morbidity and 
      mortality in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Factors that control 
      transition from mild forms of disease such as dengue fever (DF) to more 
      life-threatening forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are poorly understood. 
      Consequently, there are no reliable methods currently available for early triage of 
      DHF patients resulting in significant over-hospitalization. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: We have systematically examined the proteome, cytokines and inflammatory 
      markers in sera from 62 adult dengue patients (44 DF; 18 DHF) with primary DENV 
      infection, at three different times of infection representing the early febrile, 
      defervescence and convalescent stages. Using fluorescent bioplex assays, we measured 
      27 cytokines in these serum samples. Additionally, we used multiple mass 
      spectrometry methods for iTRAQ-based comparative analysis of serum proteome as well 
      as measurements of protein adducts- 3-nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine as 
      surrogate measures of free radical activity. Using multiple methods such as OPLS, 
      MRMR and MSVM-RFE for multivariate feature selection and classification, we report 
      molecular markers that allow prediction of primary DHF with sensitivity and 
      specificity of >80%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This report constitutes a 
      comprehensive analysis of molecular signatures of dengue disease progression and 
      will help unravel mechanisms of dengue disease progression. Our analysis resulted in 
      the identification of markers that may be useful for early prediction of DHF during 
      the febrile phase. The combination of highly sensitive analytical methods and novel 
      statistical approaches described here forms a robust platform for biomarker 
      discovery.

TI  - Larvicidal and irritant activities of hexane leaf extracts of Citrus sinensis 
      against dengue vector Aedes aegypti L.
PG  - 152-5
LID - 10.1016/S2221-1691(11)60211-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the larvicidal and irritant activities of the hexane extracts 
      of leaves of Citrus sinensis (C. sinensis) against the early fourth instars and 
      female adults of Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti). METHODS: The larvicidal potential of 
      the prepared leaf extract was evaluated against early fourth instar larvae of Ae. 
      aegypti using WHO protocol. The mortality counts were made after 24 h and LC50 and 
      LC90 values were calculated. The efficacy of extract as mosquito irritant was 
      assessed by contact irritancy assays. Extract-impregnated paper was placed on a 
      glass plate over which a perspex funnel with a hole on the top was kept inverted. 
      Single female adult, 3-day old unfed/blood-fed, was released inside the funnel. 
      After 3 min of acclimatization time, the time taken for the first take-off and total 
      number of flights undertaken during 15 min were scored. RESULTS: The citrus leaf 
      extracts from hexane possessed moderate larvicidal efficiency against dengue vector. 
      The bioassays resulted in an LC50 and LC90 value of 446.84 and 1 370.96 ppm, 
      respectively after 24 h of exposure. However, the extracts were proved to be 
      remarkable irritant against adults Ae. aegypti, more pronounced effects being 
      observed on blood-fed females than unfed females. The extract-impregnated paper was 
      thus proved to be 7-11 times more irritable as compared with the control paper. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The hexane extracts from C. sinensis leaves are proved to be reasonably 
      larvicidal but remarkably irritant against dengue vector. Further studies are needed 
      to identify the possible role of extract as adulticide, oviposition deterrent and 
      ovicidal agent. The isolation of active ingredient from the extract could help in 
      formulating strategies for mosquito control.

LID - 10.1093/infdis/jis180 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanisms of thrombocytopenia and platelet phagocytosis in dengue 
      illness are not fully understood. METHODS: A prospective hospital-based study was 
      conducted to examine the relationships between platelet counts, serum thrombopoietin 
      (TPO) levels, and platelet apoptosis and phagocytosis in 81 patients with secondary 
      dengue virus (DV) infections and 38 healthy volunteers. The apoptosis and 
      phagocytosis of cultured platelets after exposure to DV were also examined. RESULTS: 
      Platelet apoptosis, platelet phagocytosis, and serum TPO levels were increased 
      significantly in patients during the acute and early convalescence phases compared 
      with levels observed in patients during the convalescence phase and in healthy 
      volunteers. A significant correlation between platelet apoptosis and platelet 
      phagocytosis was also observed in these patients. Platelet phagocytosis was 
      inhibited significantly by the D89E mutant, which carries a point mutation in the 
      RGD motif of milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8, a 
      phosphatidylserine-recognizing bridge molecule. DV-induced platelet apoptosis and 
      increased phagocytosis of DV-induced apoptotic platelets was confirmed using in 
      vitro assays. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest an increased phagocytosis of DV-induced 
      apoptotic platelets by macrophages via a phosphatidylserine-recognizing pathway in 
      secondary DV infection. Accelerated platelet clearance, however, was overcome by 
      TPO-induced enhanced thrombopoiesis in these patients. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION:

TI  - An operative dengue risk stratification system in Argentina based on geospatial 
      technology.
PG  - S31-42
AB  - Based on an agreement between the Ministry of Health and the National Space 
      Activities Commission in Argentina, an integrated informatics platform for dengue 
      risk using geospatial technology for the surveillance and prediction of risk areas 
      for dengue fever has been designed. The task was focused on developing 
      stratification based on environmental (historical and current), viral, social and 
      entomological situation for >3,000 cities as part of a system. The platform, 
      developed with open-source software with pattern design, following the European 
      Space Agency standards for space informatics, delivers two products: a national risk 
      map consisting of point vectors for each city/town/locality and an approximate 50 m 
      resolution urban risk map modelling the risk inside selected high-risk cities. The 
      operative system, architecture and tools used in the development are described, 
      including a detailed list of end users' requirements. Additionally, an algorithm 
      based on bibliography and landscape epidemiology concepts is presented and 
      discussed. The system, in operation since September 2011, is capable of continuously 
      improving the algorithms producing improved risk stratifications without a complete 
      set of inputs. The platform was specifically developed for surveillance of dengue 
      fever as this disease has reemerged in Argentina but the aim is to widen the scope 
      to include also other relevant vector-borne diseases such as chagas, malaria and 
      leishmaniasis as well as other countries belonging to south region of Latin America.

AB  - Dengue is a significant public health problem worldwide. Despite the important 
      social and clinical impact, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral therapy for 
      prevention and treatment of dengue virus (DENV) infection. Considering the above, 
      drug discovery research for dengue is of utmost importance; in addition natural 
      marine products provide diverse and novel chemical structures with potent biological 
      activities that must be evaluated. In this study we propose a target-free approach 
      for dengue drug discovery based on a novel, rapid, and economic in situ 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the screening of a panel of marine seaweed 
      extracts. The in situ ELISA was standardized and validated for Huh7.5 cell line 
      infected with all four serotypes of DENV, among them clinical isolates and a 
      laboratory strain. Statistical analysis showed an average S/B of 7.2 and Z-factor of 
      0.62, demonstrating assay consistency and reliability. A panel of fifteen seaweed 
      extracts was then screened at the maximum non-toxic dose previously determined by 
      the MTT and Neutral Red cytotoxic assays. Eight seaweed extracts were able to reduce 
      DENV infection of at least one serotype tested. Four extracts (Phaeophyta: 
      Canistrocarpus cervicornis, Padina gymnospora; Rhodophyta: Palisada perforate; 
      Chlorophyta: Caulerpa racemosa) were chosen for further evaluation, and time of 
      addition studies point that they might act at an early stage of the viral infection 
      cycle, such as binding or internalization.

TI  - Update on temporal and spatial abundance of dengue vectors in Penang, Malaysia.
PG  - 84-92
AB  - It is important to obtain frequent measurements of the abundance, distribution, and 
      seasonality of mosquito vectors to determine the risk of disease transmission. The 
      number of cases of dengue infection has increased in recent years on Penang Island, 
      Malaysia, with recurring epidemics. However, ongoing control attempts are being 
      critically hampered by the lack of up-to-date information regarding the vectors. To 
      overcome this problem, we examined the current situation and distribution of dengue 
      vectors on the island. Residences throughout the urban, suburban, and rural areas 
      were inspected through wet and dry seasons between February 2009 and February 2010. 
      Two vectors were encountered in the survey, with Aedes aegypti present in especially 
      high numbers mostly in urban areas. Similar observations were noted for Ae. 
      albopictus in rural areas. The former species was more abundant in outdoor 
      containers, while the latter showed almost equivalent abundance both outdoors and 
      indoors. The dengue virus was active in both urban and rural areas, and the number 
      of cases of infection was higher in areas where Ae. aegypti was predominant. The 
      abundance of immature Ae. albopictus was positively correlated with rainfall (r2 = 
      0.461; P < 0.05), but this was not the case for Ae. aegypti. For both species, the 
      size of immature populations tended to increase with increasing intensity of rain, 
      but heavy rains resulted in population loss. In addition to updating data regarding 
      the larval habitats and locations (outdoors and indoors), this study highlighted the 
      importance of spatial vector control stratification, which has the potential to 
      reduce costs in control programs.

TI  - Low sensitivity of NS1 protein tests evidenced during a dengue type 2 virus outbreak 
      in Santos, Brazil, in 2010.

AB  - In 2010, a large outbreak of dengue occurred in Santos, Brazil. The detection of the 
      NS1 antigen was used for diagnosis in addition to the detection of IgG, IgM, and 
      RNA. A large number of NS1 false-negative results were obtained. A total of 379 
      RNA-positive samples were selected for thorough evaluation. NS1 was reactive in 
      37.7% of cases. Most of the cases were characterized as a secondary infection by 
      dengue 2 virus. Sequencing of NS1 positive and negative isolates did not reveal any 
      mutation that could justify the diagnostic failure. Use of existing NS1 tests in the 
      Brazilian population may present a low negative predictive value, and they should be 
      used with caution, preferentially after performing a validation with samples freshly 
      obtained during the ongoing epidemic.

LID - 758674
AB  - Dengue fever (DF) is a serious public health problem in many parts of the world, 
      and, in the absence of a vaccine, disease surveillance and mosquito vector 
      eradication are important in controlling the spread of the disease. DF is primarily 
      transmitted by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito. We compared two statistical models 
      that can be used in the surveillance and forecast of notifiable infectious diseases, 
      namely, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and the 
      Knorr-Held two-component (K-H) model. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) was 
      used to compare models. We developed the models using used data on DF notifications 
      in Singapore from January 2001 till December 2006 and then validated the models with 
      data from January 2007 till June 2008. The K-H model resulted in a slightly lower 
      MAPE value of 17.21 as compared to the ARIMA model. We conclude that the models' 
      performances are similar, but we found that the K-H model was relatively more 
      difficult to fit in terms of the specification of the prior parameters and the 
      relatively longer time taken to run the models.

TI  - Hemophagocytosis in dengue: comprehensive report of six cases.
PG  - 79-82
LID - 10.1016/j.jcv.2012.06.005 [doi]
AB  - Hemophagocytic syndrome is a potentially fatal disorder. It is being increasingly 
      reported but remained under-recognized in dengue. Most reported cases were in 
      association with plasma leakage and shock but multi-organ impairment was also 
      observed. We describe the time-lines of 6 cases of confirmed dengue with varying 
      severities of hemophagocytosis. All had persistent fever, cytopenia and elevated 
      transaminases with markedly elevated ferritin levels during and beyond the plasma 
      leakage phase. Acute renal failure and central nervous system manifestation were 
      observed in two patients. Morphological hemophagocytosis was demonstrated in three 
      patients. All survivors showed clinical and biochemical resolution of 
      hemophagocytosis indicating its transient nature. Persistence of fever and cytopenia 
      together with multi-organ dysfunction, out of proportion to and beyond the plasma 
      leakage phase should prompt clinicians to consider this phenomenon.

TI  - Human antibody response to Aedes aegypti saliva in an urban population in Bolivia: a 
      new biomarker of exposure to Dengue vector bites.
PG  - 504-10
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0477 [doi]
AB  - Aedes mosquitoes are important vectors of re-emerging diseases in developing 
      countries, and increasing exposure to Aedes in the developed world is currently a 
      source of concern. Given the limitations of current entomologic methods, there is a 
      need for a new effective way for evaluating Aedes exposure. Our objective was to 
      evaluate specific antibody responses to Aedes aegypti saliva as a biomarker for 
      vector exposure in a dengue-endemic urban area. IgG responses to saliva were strong 
      in young children and steadily waned with age. Specific IgG levels were 
      significantly higher in persons living in sites with higher Ae. aegypti density, as 
      measured by using entomologic parameters. Logistic regression showed a significant 
      correlation between IgG to saliva and exposure level, independently of either age or 
      sex. These results suggest that antibody responses to saliva could be used to 
      monitor human exposure to Aedes bites.

AB  - During August to November 2010, a dengue (DEN) outbreak occurred, and several cities 
      of Pakistan were affected. In this study, serum samples from 317 patients, based on 
      clinical symptoms and blood test, were included from Lahore, Sheikhpura and 
      Gujranwala cities for further diagnosis of different genotypes of DEN virus. The 
      samples were categorized into 2 groups: group 1 containing patients with dengue 
      fever (DF) without hemorrhagic manifestations (DF) (n=228) and group 2 involving 
      patients having DF with hemorrhagic manifestations (dengue hemorrhagic fever) 
      (n=89). The samples found positive for DEN in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) by targeting capsid and premembrane genes containing fragment of size 
      ∼2.5 kb for groups 1 and 2 were found to be 83.33% and 91.01%, respectively; 
      however, the detection limit was quite low by immunoglobulin M antibody capture 
      enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in case of both groups and was found to be 34.70% 
      and 68.53%, respectively. The 16.67% and 8.99% samples of groups 1 and 2, 
      respectively, were found negative in reverse transcriptase PCR analysis. In case of 
      group 1 and group 2, by adopting seminested multiplex PCR strategy, predominant 
      genotype was DEN virus type 2 with prevalence rates of 45.17% and 65.16%, 
      respectively. DEN virus type 1 was the second most prevailing genotype in the 
      population with prevalence rates of 18.85% and 19.10% for groups 1 and 2,

AB  - Infectious diseases are important causes of morbidity and mortality globally. 
      Epidemiologically, differences in the patterns of infectious diseases and 
      antimicrobial resistance exist across diverse geographical regions. In this review 
      on infectious diseases in the Arabian Peninsula and Egypt, the epidemiology of 
      tuberculosis, malaria and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections will be 
      addressed. The challenges of the hepatitis C epidemic in Egypt and the epidemiology 
      of this infection across the region will be reviewed. In recent years, we have seen 
      dengue endemicity become established, with major outbreaks in parts of the region. 
      Emerging data also indicate that, across the region, there is an increasing burden 
      of antibiotic resistance, with endemicity in healthcare settings and dissemination 
      into the community. New challenges include the emergence of the Alkhurma 
      haemorrhagic fever virus in Saudi Arabia. The annual Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia 
      serves as a model for the control of infectious disease in mass gatherings. As most 
      of these countries constantly experience a uniquely dynamic population influx in the 
      form of expatriate workers, tourists, or pilgrims, concerted regional and 
      international collaboration to address these public health concerns in a region that 
      lies at the crossroads for the global spread of infectious pathogens is imperative.

TI  - Associative learning in the dengue vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti: avoidance of a 
      previously attractive odor or surface color that is paired with an aversive 
      stimulus.
PG  - 218-23
LID - 10.1242/jeb.074898 [doi]
AB  - Associative learning has been shown in a variety of insects, including the 
      mosquitoes Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae. This study demonstrates 
      associative learning for the first time in Aedes aegypti, an important vector of 
      dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses. This species prefers to rest on dark 
      surfaces and is attracted to the odor of 1-octen-3-ol. After training in which a 
      dark surface alone or a dark surface with odor was paired with electric shock, 
      mosquitoes avoided the previously attractive area. The association was stronger when 
      odor was included in training, was retained for at least 60 min but not for 24 h, 
      and was equal for males and females. These results demonstrate the utility of a 
      bulk-training paradigm for mosquitoes similar to that used with Drosophila 
      melanogaster.

TI  - IL-17 level in patients with Dengue virus infection & its association with severity 
      of illness.
PG  - 613-8
LID - 10.1007/s10875-012-9855-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical symptoms of Dengue vary from mild febrile illness to severe 
      infection. A potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-17, secreted by mainly Th17 cells 
      mediate inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Role of IL-17 in pathogenesis of 
      dengue virus (DV) infection is not clear. METHODS: Total 211 dengue patients and 70 
      healthy controls were enrolled. IL-17 level was tested in serum samples from all 
      cases and controls. Cases were grouped as either dengue or severe dengue; based on 
      WHO (2009) classification. Anti DV IgG antibody detection and DV serotype specific 
      PCR were also done. Levels of IL-17 in dengue and severe dengue patients, primary 
      and secondary DV infection were compared. Association of DV serotypes with severity 
      of illness and various clinical and laboratory features with IL-17 levels were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: Of total 211cases, 90 and 121cases were presenting as dengue and 
      severe dengue illness, respectively. Levels of IL-17 were significantly higher in 
      dengue patients as compared to control. Mean level of IL-17 was higher in severe 
      cases than non severe cases; however difference was not statistically significant. 
      Stratified analysis of IL-17 level in different age group showed significantly high 
      IL-17 levels in children with severe dengue. Mean level of IL-17 was also 
      significantly higher in cases with secondary DV infection in comparison to primary 
      DV infection. Levels of IL-17 were higher in patients with DV-2 infection in 
      comparison to cases with DV-1 and DV-3 infection. Significant positive association 
      of high IL-17 levels was seen with pleural effusion and respiratory distress. 
      CONCLUSION: IL-17 appears to be associated with severe DV infection. It is very 
      important to understand the exact role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of severe DV 
      infection.

AB  - Dengue viruses are mosquito-borne viruses that cause dengue fever and dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever, both of which are globally important diseases. These viruses have 
      evolved in a transmission cycle between human hosts and mosquito vectors in various 
      tropical and subtropical environments. We previously isolated three strains of 
      dengue type 1 virus (DENV1) and 14 strains of dengue type 3 virus (DENV3) during an 
      outbreak of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever in Jakarta, Indonesia in 1988. 
      Here, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the entire envelope protein-coding 
      region among these strains. The isolates were 97.6-100% identical for DENV1 and 
      98.8-100% identical for DENV3. All DENV1 isolates were included in two different 
      clades of genotype IV and all DENV3 isolates were included in a single clade of 
      genotype I. For DENV1, three Yap Island strains isolated in 2004 were the only 
      strains closely related to the present isolates; the recently circulated Indonesian 
      strains were in different clades. Molecular clock analyses estimated that ancestors 
      of the genotype IV strains of DENV1 have been indigenous in Indonesia since 1948. We 
      predict that they diverged frequently around 1967 and that their offspring 
      distributed to Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, and Africa. For DENV3, the clade 
      containing all the present isolates also contained strains isolated from other 
      Indonesian regions and other countries including Malaysia, Singapore, China, and 
      East Timor from 1985-2010. Molecular clock analyses estimated that the common 
      ancestor of the genotype I strains of DENV3 emerged in Indonesia around 1967 and 
      diverged frequently until 1980, and that their offspring distributed mainly in 
      Southeast Asia. The first dengue outbreak in 1968 and subsequent outbreaks in 
      Indonesia might have influenced the divergence and distribution of the DENV1 
      genotype IV strains and the DENV3 genotype I strains in many countries.

      humanized mice.
PG  - 7637-49
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00534-12 [doi]
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) are transmitted to humans by the bite of Aedes aegypti or 
      Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, with millions of infections annually in over 100 
      countries. The diseases they produce, which occur exclusively in humans, are dengue 
      fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). We previously developed a humanized 
      mouse model of DF in which mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem cells 
      produced signs of DENV disease after injection with low-passage, wild-type isolates. 
      Using these mice, but now allowing infected A. aegypti to transmit dengue virus 
      during feeding, we observed signs of more severe disease (higher and more sustained 
      viremia, erythema, and thrombocytopenia). Infected mice mounted innate (gamma 
      interferon [IFN-γ] and soluble interleukin 2 receptor alpha [sIL-2Rα]) and adaptive 
      (anti-DENV antibodies) immune responses that failed to clear viremia until day 56, 
      while a mosquito bite alone induced strong immunomodulators (tumor necrosis factor 
      alpha [TNF-α], IL-4, and IL-10) and thrombocytopenia. This is the first animal model 
      that allows an evaluation of human immunity to DENV infection after mosquito 
      inoculation.

AB  - Dengue virus is a worldwide health problem, with billions of people at risk 
      annually. Dengue virus causes a spectrum of diseases, namely dengue fever, dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome with the latter two being linked to 
      death. Understanding how dengue is able to evade the immune system and cause 
      enhanced severity of disease is the main topics of interest in the Fernandez-Sesma 
      laboratory at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Using primary human immune cells, our 
      group investigates the contribution of dengue virus-specific proteins to the evasion 
      of innate immunity by this virus and the host factors that the virus interacts with 
      in order to evade immune recognition and to establish infection in humans. Here, we 
      review recent findings from our group as well as published data from other groups 
      regarding immune modulation by dengue virus.

AB  - Type I interferons (IFN) have been shown to play an important role for inhibiting 
      Dengue virus (DENV) infection. Identifying IFN-induced cellular proteins are 
      essential for understanding its mechanisms against DENV. Here we established stable 
      Huh7-derived cell lines expressing the IFN-induced cell membrane protein BST2 
      (Huh7-BST2) or its variant bearing a V5 tag at the C-terminal (Huh7-BST5CV5). These 
      cell lines were infected with DENV to determine proteins modulating their anti-DENV 
      response. We found that expression of BST2 did not affect the efficiency of DENV 
      infection and intracellular replication. Rather, it significantly reduced the virion 
      yield of the infected cells, particularly at low MOI infection. In addition, BST2 
      also decreased the foci formation and the size of infectious foci in cultured Huh7 
      monolayers with media containing methocellulose. The addition of the V5 tag at 
      C-terminal inhibited the GPI modification of BST2 and blocked its shift from 
      endoplasm to cytoplastic membrane. BST2CV5 did not affect DENV infection and foci 
      formation in Huh7 cells but reduced virion yield by 1 log at low MOI infection. 
      Interestingly, intracellular BST2CV5 expression was reduced by high level of DENV 
      production. CONCLUSION: Our results imply that BST2 is a functional mediator of the 
      IFN response against DENV infection. BST2 inhibits the release of DENV virions from 
      Huh7 cells and limits viral cell-to-cell transmission. BST2CV5 variant is unable to 
      inhibit DENV release but impairs viral infection in cells.

AB  - In this work we propose a mathematical approach to estimate the dengue force of 
      infection, the average age of dengue first infection, the optimum age to vaccinate 
      children against dengue in a routine fashion and the optimum age interval to 
      introduce the dengue vaccine in a mass vaccination campaign. The model is based on 
      previously published models for vaccination against other childhood infections, 
      which resulted in actual vaccination programmes in Brazil. The model was applied for 
      three areas of distinct levels of endemicity of the city of Recife in Northeastern 
      State of Pernambuco, Brazil. Our results point to an optimal age to introduce the 
      dengue vaccine in the routine immunization programme at two years of age and an age 
      interval to introduce a mass vaccination between three and 14 years of age.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock 
      syndrome, both considered major public-health problems worldwide. We generated a 
      lethal DENV-2 strain (D220) by 10 additional cycles of subcutaneous inoculation of 
      mice with supernatant from mosquito cells infected with the previously characterized 
      strain D2S10, followed by harvesting of serum. D220 induces mortality at ten-fold 
      lower doses than D2S10 in mice lacking only the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) 
      receptor in C57BL/6 or 129 backgrounds under both non-enhanced and antibody-enhanced 
      conditions. Sequence analysis of the complete viral genome revealed five amino acid 
      changes between D220 and D2S10, of which two (K122I in envelope and V115A in NS4B) 
      appear to account for the observed phenotypic differences between the viruses. By 
      causing mortality at lower doses in C57BL/6 mice lacking only the IFN-α/β receptor, 
      D220 constitutes an improved tool for study of DENV-induced pathogenesis, as well as 
      for testing potential vaccines and antiviral drugs against DENV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue dynamics are driven by complex interactions between human-hosts, 
      mosquito-vectors and viruses that are influenced by environmental and climatic 
      factors. The objectives of this study were to analyze and model the relationships 
      between climate, Aedes aegypti vectors and dengue outbreaks in Noumea (New 
      Caledonia), and to provide an early warning system. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 
      Epidemiological and meteorological data were analyzed from 1971 to 2010 in Noumea. 
      Entomological surveillance indices were available from March 2000 to December 2009. 
      During epidemic years, the distribution of dengue cases was highly seasonal. The 
      epidemic peak (March-April) lagged the warmest temperature by 1-2 months and was in 
      phase with maximum precipitations, relative humidity and entomological indices. 
      Significant inter-annual correlations were observed between the risk of outbreak and 
      summertime temperature, precipitations or relative humidity but not ENSO. 
      Climate-based multivariate non-linear models were developed to estimate the yearly 
      risk of dengue outbreak in Noumea. The best explicative meteorological variables 
      were the number of days with maximal temperature exceeding 32°C during 
      January-February-March and the number of days with maximal relative humidity 
      exceeding 95% during January. The best predictive variables were the maximal 
      temperature in December and maximal relative humidity during 
      October-November-December of the previous year. For a probability of dengue outbreak 
      above 65% in leave-one-out cross validation, the explicative model predicted 94% of 
      the epidemic years and 79% of the non epidemic years, and the predictive model 79% 
      and 65%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The epidemic dynamics of dengue in 
      Noumea were essentially driven by climate during the last forty years. Specific 
      conditions based on maximal temperature and relative humidity thresholds were 
      determinant in outbreaks occurrence. Their persistence was also crucial. An 
      operational model that will enable health authorities to anticipate the outbreak 
      risk was successfully developed. Similar models may be developed to improve dengue 
      management in other countries.

AB  - We report the first isolation of Dengue virus 4 (DENV-4) in the state of São Paulo, 
      from two patients - one living in São José do Rio Preto and the other one in Paulo 
      de Faria, both cities located in the Northwest region of the state. The virus 
      isolations were accomplished in the clone C6/36 Aedes albopictus cell line, followed 
      by indirect immunofluorescence assays, performed with type-specific monoclonal 
      antibodies that showed positive reactions for DENV-4. The results were confirmed by 
      Nested RT-PCR and Real-Time RT-PCR assays. The introduction of DENV-4 in a country 
      that already has to deal with the transmission of three other serotypes increases 
      the possibility of the occurrence of more severe cases of the disease. The 
      importance of early detection of dengue cases, before the virus spreads and major 
      outbreaks occur, should be emphasized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although most symptomatic dengue infections follow an uncomplicated 
      course, complications and unusual manifestations are increasingly being reported due 
      to rising disease burden. Expanded dengue syndrome is a new entity added into World 
      Health Organization (WHO) classification system to incorporate this wide spectrum of 
      unusual manifestations. We report a case of expanded dengue syndrome with subacute 
      thyroiditis and intracerebral hemorrhage. This is the first case report of 
      thyroiditis in dengue infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20 years old man presented 
      with fever, myalgias, arthralgias, retro-orbital pain, vomiting and gum bleeding 
      during a large dengue outbreak in Lahore, Pakistan. On 7th day of illness patient 
      became afebrile, but he developed severe headaches, unconsciousness followed by 
      altered behavior. On 9th day of illness patient developed painful neck swelling 
      accompanied by fever, tremors, palpitations, hoarseness of voice and odynophagia. 
      Examination revealed acutely swollen, tender thyroid gland along with features of 
      hyperthyroidism. Laboratory evaluation revealed stable hematocrit, thrombocytopenia 
      and leukopenia. Patient had seroconverted for anti-dengue IgM antibodies on the 10th 
      day of illness. A non-contrast Computed Tomogram (CT) of the brain showed right 
      frontal lobe hematoma. Thyroid profile showed increased free T3 and T4 and low TSH. 
      Technetium thyroid scan showed reduced tracer uptake. He was diagnosed as having 
      subacute thyroiditis and treated with oral prednisolone and propranolol. Follow up 
      CT brain showed resolving hematoma. Patient's recovery was uneventful. CONCLUSION: 
      Subacute thyroiditis may develop during the course of dengue fever and should be 
      included as a manifestation of expanded dengue syndrome. It should be suspected in 
      patients with dengue fever who develop painful thyroid swelling and clinical 
      features of hyperthyroidism.

AB  - Dengue has become endemic in India with outbreaks occurring almost every year. The 
      seroprevalence and serotypic data of the last 7 years in samples obtained from 
      suspected dengue patients from a tertiary care hospital were analyzed. Out of 7846 
      serum samples received in the virology laboratory from suspected dengue cases during 
      2002 to 2008, 2366 (30.15%) were serologically confirmed. Serotyping was done using 
      mRT-PCR. All the four serotypes were detected in 2003, while data in 2004, 2005 and 
      2006 revealed the the predominance of Den-3. In the year 2007 predominance of Den-2 
      was observed, whereas in 2008 Den-1 was the most common serotype isolated. Overall, 
      Den-2 and Den-3 were the most predominant serotypes during 2003-2007 but Den-1 
      replaced these strains in the year 2008. Since the emergence of a new predominant 
      strain can lead to the occurrence of an outbreak, presence of Den-1 in the year 2008 
      would pose an alarming situation before us. Well-targeted population-based 
      epidemiological studies are urgently required to control dengue menace.

TI  - The influence of larval density, food stress, and parasitism on the bionomics of the 
      dengue vector Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae): implications for integrated vector 
      management.
PG  - 221-9

AB  - New larval control strategies for integrated vector management of Aedes aegypti are 
      in high demand, including the use of biological control agents. Exposure of Aedes 
      aegypti to parasites, starvation, and overcrowded conditions during larval 
      development reduces the probability of survival to eclosion, can directly affect 
      fitness parameters such as adult size and fecundity, and can affect the size, 
      provisioning, and viability of eggs produced by females. We compared these 
      parameters after exposing larvae to 1) abundant food at low larval densities, 2) 
      food deprivation and high larval density, and 2) infection with the endoparasite 
      Plagiorchis elegans, an entomopathogenic digenean trematode. Female mosquitoes that 
      eclosed from larval conditions of starvation and overcrowding were smaller and laid 
      fewer and smaller eggs than controls. The proportion of females to complete an 
      oviposition cycle was reduced in the P. elegans-infected treatment group. Parasite 
      load was negatively correlated with wing length and egg size. Infection of Ae. 
      aegypti with P. elegans has sublethal effects and may reduce population-level 
      reproductive output, but one-time low-density P. elegans exposure does not have 
      sufficient effect on Ae. aegypti fitness parameters to be considered a viable 
      biocontrol option.

TI  - Dose- and schedule-dependent protective efficacy of celgosivir in a lethal mouse 
      model for dengue virus infection informs dosing regimen for a proof of concept 
      clinical trial.

LID - S0166-3542(12)00169-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.07.008 [doi]
AB  - Celgosivir (6-O-butanoyl castanospermine), a pro-drug of the naturally occurring 
      castanospermine, is an inhibitor of α-glucosidase I and II that is found to be a 
      potent inhibitor of several enveloped viruses including all four serotypes of dengue 
      virus. We showed previously that the compound fully protected AG129 mice from lethal 
      infection with a mouse adapted dengue virus at a dose of 50mg/kg twice daily (BID) 
      for 5days and was effective even after 48h delayed treatment. Here we show that the 
      protection by celgosivir is dose- and schedule-dependent and that a twice-a-day 
      regimen of 50, 25 or 10mg/kg is more protective than a single daily dose of 
      100mg/kg. Treatment with 50mg/kg BID castanospermine had comparable efficacy as 
      25mg/kg BID celgosivir, suggesting that celgosivir is approximately twice as potent 
      as castanospermine with respect to in vivo antiviral efficacy. Pharmacokinetics (PK) 
      studies of celgosivir in mice showed that it rapidly metabolized to castanospermine. 
      Simulation of the PK data with the survival data for the various doses of celgosivir 
      tested suggests that the steady-state minimum concentration is a critical parameter 
      to note in choosing dose and schedule. These results influenced the selection of the 
      dose regimen for a proof-of-concept clinical trial of celgosivir as a treatment 
      against dengue fever.

TI  - Global trends in the use of insecticides to control vector-borne diseases.
PG  - 577-82
LID - 10.1289/ehp.1104340 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on insecticide use for vector control are essential for guiding 
      pesticide management systems on judicious and appropriate use, resistance 
      management, and reduction of risks to human health and the environment. OBJECTIVE: 
      We studied the global use and trends of insecticide use for control of vector-borne 
      diseases for the period 2000 through 2009. METHODS: A survey was distributed to 
      countries with vector control programs to request national data on vector control 
      insecticide use, excluding the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LNs). Data 
      were received from 125 countries, representing 97% of the human populations of 143 
      targeted countries. RESULTS: The main disease targeted with insecticides was 
      malaria, followed by dengue, leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease. The use of vector 
      control insecticides was dominated by organochlorines [i.e., DDT 
      (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane)] in terms of quantity applied (71% of total) and 
      by pyrethroids in terms of the surface or area covered (81% of total). Global use of 
      DDT for vector control, most of which was in India alone, was fairly constant during 
      2000 through 2009. In Africa, pyrethroid use increased in countries that also 
      achieved high coverage for LNs, and DDT increased sharply until 2008 but dropped in 
      2009. CONCLUSIONS: The global use of DDT has not changed substantially since the 
      Stockholm Convention went into effect. The dominance of pyrethroid use has major 
      implications because of the spread of insecticide resistance with the potential to 
      reduce the efficacy of LNs. Managing insecticide resistance should be coordinated 
      between disease-specific programs and sectors of public health and agriculture 
      within the context of an integrated vector management approach.

      productive vector breeding-sites. METHODS: The study was conducted as a cluster 
      randomized community trial using "reduction of the vector population" as the main 
      outcome variable. The trial had two arms: 10 intervention clusters (neighborhoods) 
      and 10 control clusters in the town of Poptun Guatemala. Activities included 
      entomological assessments (characteristics of breeding-sites, pupal productivity, 
      Stegomyia indices) at baseline, 6 weeks after the first intervention (coverage of 
      window and exterior doorways made of PermaNet 2.0 netting, factory treated with 
      deltamethrin at 55 mg/m2, and of 200 L drums with similar treated material) and 6 
      weeks after the second intervention (combination of treated materials and other 
      suitable interventions targeting productive breeding-sites i.e larviciding with 
      Temephos, elimination etc.). The second intervention took place 17 months after the 
      first intervention. The insecticide residual activity and the insecticidal content 
      were also studied at different intervals. Additionally, information about 
      demographic characteristics, cost of the intervention, coverage of houses protected 
      and satisfaction in the population with the interventions was collected. RESULTS: At 
      baseline (during the dry season) a variety of productive container types for Aedes 
      pupae were identified: various container types holding >20 L, 200 L drums, 
      washbasins and buckets (producing 83.7% of all pupae). After covering 100% of 
      windows and exterior doorways and a small number of drums (where the commercial 
      cover could be fixed) in 970 study households, tropical rains occurred in the area 
      and lead to an increase of the vector population, more pronounced (but statistically 
      not significant) in the control arm than in the intervention arm. In the second 
      intervention (17 months later and six weeks after implementing the second 
      intervention) the combined approach of ITMs and a combination of appropriate 
      interventions against productive containers (Temephos in >200 L water drums, 
      elimination of small discarded tins and bottles) lead to significant differences on 
      reductions of the total number of pupae (P = 0.04) and the House index (P = 0.01) 
      between intervention and control clusters, and to borderline differences on 
      reductions of the Pupae per Person and Breteau indices (P = 0.05). The insecticide 
      residual activity on treated curtains was high until month 18 but the chemical 
      concentration showed a high variability. The cost per house protected with treated 
      curtains and drum covers and targeting productive breeding-sites of the dengue 
      vector was $ 5.31 USD. The acceptance of the measure was generally high, 
      particularly in families who had experienced dengue. CONCLUSION: Even under 
      difficult environmental conditions (open houses, tropical rainfall, challenging 
      container types mainly in the peridomestic environment) the combination of 
      insecticide treated curtains and to a less extent drum covers and interventions 
      targeting the productive container types can reduce the dengue vector population 
      significantly.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Studies directed to investigate ecological parameters of sylvatic 
      mosquitoes populations permit the establishment of risk levels in the transmission 
      of arboviruses and provide the basis for recommendations to health authorities about 
      prevention, surveillance and control. OBJECTIVE: To establish the diversity and 
      abundance of mosquitoes vectors of arbovirus in rural areas of Apartadó and Turbo, 
      Antioquia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quarterly sampling was done. For mosquito 
      collections in forest fragments, CDC traps, Shannon traps and human landing methods 
      were used. Diversity and abundance indices were calculated. RESULTS: Five hundred 
      eighty-three mosquitoes were collected and identified in 10 genera and 27 species. 
      The most abundant species were as follows: Coquilletidia venezuelensis (14.6%), 
      Aedes scapularis (14.1%), Psorophora ferox (10.8%) and Culex quinquefasciatus 
      (10.3%). Species richness and ecological indexes were highest in Turbo municipality; 
      where the forest fragment was considered highest in species richness and uniformity. 
      The identification in the samples of Culex pedroi,Ae. scapularis, Aedes 
      angustivittatus, Cq. venezuelensis, Culex nigripalpus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Culex 
      declarator, Mansonia titillans, Mansonia pseudotitillans, Ps. ferox and 
      Trichoprosopon. Digitatum--all previously reported as arbovirus vectors--warns about 
      the possibility of arbovirus transmission in the zone. CONCLUSIONS: Mosquito 
      diversity and abundance in the study area was very high. The ecological analysis, 
      plus previous reports about vector competence of several of the recorded species, 
      permits the conclusion that arbovirus outbreaks can occur in the Urabá region.

AB  - A prototype dengue-1 DNA vaccine was shown to be safe and immunogenic in a previous 
      Phase 1 clinical trial. Anti-dengue-1 neutralizing antibody responses were 
      detectable only in the group of volunteers receiving the high dose of nonadjuvanted 
      vaccine and the antibody titers were low. Vaxfectin(®), a lipid-based adjuvant, 
      enhances the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. We conducted a nonhuman primate study 
      to evaluate the effect of Vaxfectin(®) on the immunogenicity of a tetravalent dengue 
      DNA vaccine. Animals were immunized on days 0, 28 and 84, with each immunization 
      consisting of 3mg of Vaxfectin(®)-adjuvanted tetravalent dengue DNA vaccine. The use 
      of Vaxfectin(®) resulted in a significant increase in anti-dengue neutralizing 
      antibody responses against dengue-1, -3 and -4. There was little to no effect on T 
      cell responses as measured by interferon gamma ELISPOT assay. Animals immunized with 
      the Vaxfectin(®)-formulated tetravalent DNA vaccine showed significant protection 
      against live dengue-2 virus challenge compared to control animals (0.75 mean days of 
      viremia vs 3.3 days). Animals vaccinated with nonadjuvanted DNA had a mean 2.0 days 
      of viremia. These results support further evaluation of the Vaxfectin(®)-adjuvanted 
      tetravalent dengue DNA vaccine in a Phase 1 clinical trial.

AB  - Flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV), are among the 
      most prevalent human disease-causing arboviruses world-wide. As they continue to 
      expand their geographic range, multivalent flavivirus vaccines may become an 
      important public health tool. Here we describe the immune kinetics of WNV DNA 
      vaccination and the identification of a CD4 epitope that increases heterologous 
      flavivirus vaccine immunogenicity. Lethal WNV challenge two days post-vaccination 
      resulted in 90% protection with complete protection by four days, and was temporally 
      associated with a rapid influx of activated CD4 T cells. CD4 T cells from WNV 
      vaccinated mice could be stimulated from epitopic regions in the envelope protein 
      transmembrane domain. Incorporation of this WNV epitope into DENV-2 DNA and 
      virus-like particle vaccines significantly increased neutralizing antibody titers. 
      Incorporating such potent epitopes into multivalent flavivirus vaccines could 
      improve their immunogenicity and may help alleviate concerns of imbalanced immunity 
      in multivalent vaccine approaches.

AB  - A study was conducted in the city of Salto, Uruguay, to identify mosquito-producing 
      containers, the spatial distribution of mosquitoes and the relationship between the 
      different population indices of Aedes aegypti. On each of 312 premises visited, 
      water-filled containers and immature Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were identified. The 
      containers were counted and classified into six categories. Pupae per person and 
      Stegomyia indices were calculated. Pupae per person were represented spatially. The 
      number of each type of container and number of mosquitoes in each were analyzed and 
      compared, and their spatial distribution was analyzed. No significant differences in 
      the number of the different types of containers with mosquitoes or in the number of 
      mosquitoes in each were found. The distribution of the containers with mosquito was 
      random and the distribution of mosquitoes by type of container was aggregated or 
      highly aggregated.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is little data on the duration of viraemia 
      following infection with Ross River virus (RRV), the most common cause of arbovirus 
      disease in Australia. In particular, no accurate estimate exists for the duration of 
      pre-symptomatic RRV infection, which is important in assessing the potential for 
      transfusion transmission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used an established mouse model 
      of RRV infection involving adult Swiss outbred mice to measure viraemia following 
      infection. Applying our experimental data to a published probabilistic model for 
      estimating the risk of dengue transmission by transfused blood, we derived 
      comparable risk estimates for RRV. RESULTS: Ross River virus RNA was measured using 
      highly sensitive real-time PCR in serum samples to determine the duration of 
      asymptomatic viraemia, which typically lasted 5 days, but extended to 9 days in some 
      mice. Assuming the potential for transfusion transmission is proven, the risk of RRV 
      transmission by blood during a 2004 outbreak in Cairns, Australia was 
      retrospectively estimated as 1 in 13,542 (range from 1 in 4765 to 47,563). 
      CONCLUSION: This study provides updated epidemiological data useful to underpin 
      modelling to assess the potential risk of transfusion-transmitted RRV. Using an 
      established model for dengue, the risk estimate for RRV transmission is comparable 
      in the same geographical region. Should transfusion be proven as a route of 
      transmission, this supports consideration of appropriate mitigation strategies to 
      safeguard blood recipients.

AB  - Humans develop polyclonal, serotype-specific neutralizing antibody responses after 
      dengue virus (DENV) infection. Many mouse antibodies that neutralize DENV bind to 
      the lateral ridge or A strand epitopes on domain III of the viral envelope (EDIII) 
      protein. It has been assumed that these epitopes are also the main target of human 
      neutralizing antibodies. Using recombinant dengue serotype 2 viruses with altered 
      EDIII epitopes, we demonstrate that EDIII epitopes are not the main target of human 
      neutralizing antibody.

AB  - During 1960-80 dengue disease profile in India was mild despite circulation of all 
      four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). Increase in disease severity with a 
      concomitant change in the population of DENV-1 and 2 have been reported since then. 
      To determine population dynamics of DENV-3 and 4, the envelope (E) gene sequence was 
      determined for 16 Indian isolates of DENV-3 and 11 of DENV-4 and analyzed together 
      with 97 DENV-3 and 43 DENV-4 global sequences. All Indian DENV-3 isolates belonged 
      to genotype III, lineages C, D, E and F. Lineage F was newly identified and 
      represented non-circulating viruses. Three non-conservative amino acid changes in 
      domain I, II & III were identified during the transition from lineages F/E, 
      associated with mild disease, to A-D, associated with severe disease. For DENV-4, 
      the current viruses clustered in genotype I, lineage C, whilst the isolates from 
      1960s formed the new genotype V. A 1979 Indian isolate of DENV-4 was found to be an 
      inter-genotypic recombinant of Sri Lankan isolate (1978) of genotype I and Indian 
      isolate (1961) of genotype V. The rates of nucleotide substitution and time to the 
      most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) estimated for DENV-3 (1782-1934) and DENV-4 
      (1719-1931) were similar to earlier reports. However, the divergence time for 
      genotype III of DENV-3, 1938-1963, was a more accurate estimate with the inclusion 
      of Indian isolates from the 1960s. By phylogeographical analysis it was revealed 
      that DENV-3 GIII viruses emerged from India and evolved through Sri Lanka whilst 
      DENV-4 emerged and dispersed from India. The present study demonstrates the crucial 
      role that India/Sri Lanka have played in the evolution and dispersion of the major 
      genotypes, GIII of DENV-3 and GI of DENV-4 which are more virulent and show higher 
      dissemination potential.

AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease of humans, and animal models that 
      recapitulate human immune responses or dengue pathogenesis are needed to understand 
      the pathogenesis of the disease. We recently described an animal model for dengue 
      virus (DENV) infection using humanized NOD-scid IL2rγ(null) mice (NSG) engrafted 
      with cord blood haematopoietic stem cells. We sought to further improve this model 
      by co-transplantation of human fetal thymus and liver tissues into NSG (BLT-NSG) 
      mice. Enhanced DENV-specific antibody titres were found in the sera of BLT-NSG mice 
      compared with human cord blood haematopoietic stem cell-engrafted NSG mice. 
      Furthermore, B cells generated during the acute phase and in memory from splenocytes 
      of immunized BLT-NSG mice secreted DENV-specific IgM antibodies with neutralizing 
      activity. Human T cells in engrafted BLT-NSG mice secreted interferon-γ in response 
      to overlapping DENV peptide pools and HLA-A2 restricted peptides. The BLT-NSG mice 
      will allow assessment of human immune responses to DENV vaccines and the effects of 
      previous immunity on subsequent DENV infections.

AB  - A chitosan-modified carbon fiber electrode (CFE) for dengue virus envelope protein 
      (DENV) was developed. Antibodies against DENV were covalently immobilized on the 
      chitosan (CHIT) matrix after activation with sodium periodate. Cyclic voltammetries 
      and scanning electron microscopies analysis were performed to monitor steps involved 
      in the CFE surface modification. Amperometric response of the competitive 
      immunoassays was generated by hydrogen peroxide reaction with the peroxidase 
      conjugated to DENV and 2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) 
      as mediator. The immunosensor showed a lower limit of detection for DENV (0.94 ng 
      mL(-1)) than previously described and a linear range from 1.0 to 175 ng mL(-1), in 
      concentration levels clinically relevant for dengue virus diagnosis. The intra- and 
      inter-assay were respectively 5.8% and 3.6%. The unique and simple design of this 
      immunoassay format provides an economical alternative for the manufacture of other 
      sensitive sensors.

TI  - User fee exemption does not affect lower rates of hospital admission of girls in 
      Vietnam.
PG  - 582-9
LID - 10.1093/heapol/czr079 [doi]
AB  - In many countries, girls have been reported to be less often admitted to hospital 
      than boys. We studied the influence of socio-economic factors, education and access 
      to health care on girls' and boys' admission rates for pneumonia, diarrhoea and 
      dengue fever in south-central Vietnam. We explored whether the user fee exemption 
      for children under 6 years introduced in 2005 had an impact on girls' admission 
      rates. In a cohort analysis, we used data from a large census in Khanh Hoa Province 
      conducted in 2006, linked to hospital admission records at individual level. We 
      further analysed a cross-sectional health care utilization survey in a sample of 
      children reported ill at the census. There were 38 731 children under 6 years among 
      a total census population of 353 891. Overall, girls under the age of 6 years were 
      29% less likely to be admitted to hospital than boys. The gender differences in 
      admission rates in children under 6 years were similar for diarrhoea, pneumonia and 
      dengue. None of the socio-economic and educational factors appeared to affect the 
      gender difference. The user fee exemption starting from October 2005 had no impact 
      on the girls/boys rate ratio of admission. In conclusion, the higher hospital 
      admission rates of boys compared with girls in Vietnam are independent of 
      socio-economic factors and user fees. Higher susceptibility of boys to severe 
      disease could explain part of the gender gap, but profound cultural norms and 
      beliefs may also have contributed to the findings.

      sent for clinical analysis to determine the actual cause of the illness, but reports 
      were inconclusive. METHODS: The present study describes the clinical observations 
      and laboratory investigations involving molecular methods performed on 170 of the 
      2000 clinically suspected cases. These were patients who were admitted to Aravind 
      Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu with ocular complications. Conventional reverse 
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, and reverse 
      transcription loop-mediated isothermal gene amplification (RT-LAMP) assays were used 
      to detect West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Further investigation of the genetic 
      diversity of the WNV implicated in ocular complications was undertaken by sequence 
      phylogeny. RESULTS: Out of 170 samples, 25 (15%) were positive for chikungunya IgM 
      antibody, 10 (6%) for chikungunya antigen, and 30 (18%) were positive for dengue IgM 
      antibody. The remaining 105 seronegative samples were further processed for WNV 
      detection by IgM capture ELISA and molecular methods. Out of the 105 samples, 35 
      (33%) were positive for WNV IgM antibody, 15 (14%) were positive for WNV by RT-PCR, 
      and 27 (26%) were found to be positive for WNV by both real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP 
      assays. Comparative evaluation with acute-phase patient serum samples revealed 100% 
      concordance between the real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays. These assays had an 
      overall higher sensitivity than the conventional RT-PCR as they picked up 12 
      additional samples with a low copy number of template. Further genotyping through 
      sequence phylogeny revealed that all the WNV isolates were grouped in lineage I. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The association of West Nile virus with ocular infection in South India 
      during an epidemic of mysterious fever in the first half of 2010 was clearly 
      established through molecular approaches employing envelope gene-specific real-time 
      RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays followed by nucleotide sequencing.

TI  - Nitric oxide activity in platelets of dengue haemorrhagic fever patients: the 
      apparent paradoxical role of ADMA and l-NMMA.
PG  - 174-9
LID - 10.1016/j.trstmh.2011.10.009 [doi]
AB  - Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a prevalent acute disease that occurs in patients 
      infected by an arbovirus in tropical and subtropical regions. We have previously 
      shown increased intraplatelet nitric oxide (NO) production in patients with dengue 
      fever associated with reduced platelet aggregation. In this study, l-arginine 
      transport as well as expression and activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms 
      in the presence or absence of l-arginine analogues were examined in 23 DHF patients. 
      l-arginine transport and NOS activity in platelets were increased in patients with 
      DHF compared with controls. However, platelet endothelial NOS (eNOS) and inducible 
      (iNOS) protein levels did not differ between healthy controls and DHF patients. 
      Endogenous or exogenous analogues did not inhibit platelet NOS activity from DHF 
      patients. In contrast, endogenous l-arginine analogues [N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine 
      (l-NMMA) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)] inhibited NOS activity in platelets 
      from healthy subjects. These results show the first evidence that the intraplatelet 
      l-arginine-NO pathway is activated in DHF patients. The lack of inhibition of NO 
      formation in vitro by all l-arginine analogues tested in DHF platelets may suggest 
      another mechanism by which NOS activity can be regulated.

TI  - Sources of dengue viruses imported into Queensland, australia, 2002-2010.
PG  - 1850-7
LID - 10.3201/eid1811.120014 [doi]
AB  - To assess risk for importation of dengue virus (DENV) into Queensland, Australia, 
      and sources of imported viruses, we sequenced the envelope region of DENV isolates 
      from symptomatic patients with a history of travel during 2002-2010. The number of 
      imported dengue cases greatly increased over the surveillance period, some of which 
      were associated with domestic outbreaks. Patients reported traveling to (in order) 
      Asia, Papua New Guinea, Pacific Island countries, and non-Asia-Pacific countries. By 
      using phylogenetic methods, we assigned DENV isolates from returning residents and 
      overseas visitors with viremia to a specific genotypic group. Genotypes circulating 
      in Asia were extremely diverse. Genotyping and molecular clock analysis supported 
      Asian origination of a strain that caused an outbreak of DENV-4 in Pacific Island 
      countries during 2007-2009, and subsequently, in Innisfail, Australia, in 2009. Our 
      findings indicate that Asia is a major source of DENVs that are imported into 
      Australia, causing a risk for epidemics.

TI  - Recent introduction and rapid dissemination of Chikungunya virus and Dengue virus 
      serotype 2 associated with human and mosquito coinfections in Gabon, central Africa.
PG  - e45-53
LID - 10.1093/cid/cis530 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) were 
      recently introduced in central Africa, along with Aedes albopictus. Simultaneous 
      outbreaks of CHIKV and DENV-2 have subsequently occurred, in Cameroon in 2006 and 
      Gabon in 2007. METHODS: To study the spread of the 2 viruses, we conducted active 
      surveillance of acute febrile syndromes throughout Gabon between 2007 and 2010. 
      Diagnostic methods included quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase 
      chain reaction, and molecular characterization was based on partial envelope gene 
      sequences. RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2010, 4287 acutely febrile patients were 
      investigated for CHIKV and DENV-2 infections, of whom 1567 were CHIKV-positive, 376 
      DENV-2-positive, and 37 coinfected. We diagnosed 153 CHIKV and 11 DENV-2 cases in 
      2008, and 5 CHIKV and 9 DENV-2 cases in 2009. In 2010, CHIKV and DENV-2 caused a 
      second large simultaneous outbreak. Among 2826 acutely febrile patients examined 
      during this outbreak, 1112 were CHIKV-positive, 288 DENV-2-positive, and 28 
      coinfected. Mosquitoes were collected near the homes of coinfected patients, and 1 
      Aedes albopictus specimen was found to be positive for both CHIKV and DENV-2. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings show the rapid dissemination of CHIKV and DENV-2 within 
      a nonimmune population in a tropical African country, probably facilitated by the 
      spread of Aedes albopictus. This has resulted in major simultaneous outbreaks with 
      numerous coinfections in both human and mosquito.

TI  - C-terminal helical domains of dengue virus type 4 E protein affect the 
      expression/stability of prM protein and conformation of prM and E proteins.
PG  - e52600
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0052600 [doi]
LID - e52600
AB  - BACKGROUND: The envelope (E) protein of dengue virus (DENV) is the major immunogen 
      for dengue vaccine development. At the C-terminus are two α-helices (EH1 and EH2) 
      and two transmembrane domains (ET1 and ET2). After synthesis, E protein forms a 
      heterodimer with the precursor membrane (prM) protein, which has been shown as a 
      chaperone for E protein and could prevent premature fusion of E protein during 
      maturation. Recent reports of enhancement of DENV infectivity by anti-prM monoclonal 
      antibodies (mAbs) suggest the presence of prM protein in dengue vaccine is 
      potentially harmful. A better understanding of prM-E interaction and its effect on 
      recognition of E and prM proteins by different antibodies would provide important 
      information for future design of safe and effective subunit dengue vaccines. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we examined a series of C-terminal 
      truncation constructs of DENV4 prME, E and prM. In the absence of E protein, prM 
      protein expressed poorly. In the presence of E protein, the expression of prM 
      protein increased in a dose-dependent manner. Radioimmunoprecipitation, sucrose 
      gradient sedimentation and pulse-chase experiments revealed ET1 and EH2 were 
      involved in prM-E interaction and EH2 in maintaining the stability of prM protein. 
      Dot blot assay revealed E protein affected the recognition of prM protein by an 
      anti-prM mAb; truncation of EH2 or EH1 affected the recognition of E protein by 
      several anti-E mAbs, which was further verified by capture ELISA. The E protein 
      ectodomain alone can be recognized well by all anti-E mAbs tested. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A C-terminal domain (EH2) of DENV E protein can affect the 
      expression and stability of its chaperone prM protein. These findings not only add 
      to our understanding of the interaction between prM and E proteins, but also suggest 
      the ectodomain of E protein alone could be a potential subunit immunogen without 
      inducing anti-prM response.

TI  - [Thirty years after the Cuban dengue hemorrhagic epidemic occurred in 1981].
PG  - 5-14
AB  - Cuba reported the first dengue hemorrhagic fever epidemic in the American region in 
      1981. More than 344 203 cases with 10 312 severe and very severe cases and 158 
      fatalities were reported. Thirty years after this epidemic, the established 
      surveillance, the control actions and the performed research studies have allowed 
      the country to keep free of dengue, although some epidemics and waves of 
      transmission have occurred, which have finally been eliminated. This paper 
      summarized some interesting aspects related with this epidemic as well as with the 
      laboratory surveillance and results of some of the main research works.

AB  - During 2000-2011, U.S. Air Force Public Health Officers reported 770 cases of 
      vectorborne and zoonotic diseases diagnosed at Air Force medical treatment 
      facilities. Cases of Lyme disease accounted for 70 percent (n=538) of all cases and 
      most cases of Lyme disease (57%) were reported from bases in the northeastern U.S. 
      and in Germany. The annual numbers of reported Lyme disease cases were much higher 
      during the last four years than earlier in the surveillance period. The next most 
      commonly reported events were malaria (74 cases), Rocky Mountain spotted fever 
      (RMSF) (41), Q fever (33), dengue (23), and leishmaniasis (20). These five 
      infections and Lyme disease accounted for 95 percent of the reported conditions. 
      Military service members accounted for a majority of the reported cases for most of 
      the conditions, but family members and retirees accounted for most of the cases of 
      Lyme disease and RMSF. Most reports of vectorborne and zoonotic diseases did not 
      include mentions of recent travel.

      virus infection.

LID - 10.1021/cb300420z [doi]
AB  - Many cellular factors are regulated via mechanisms affecting protein conformation, 
      localization, and function that may be undetected by most commonly used RNA- and 
      protein-based profiling methods that monitor steady-state gene expression. 
      Mass-spectrometry-based chemoproteomic profiling provides alternatives for 
      interrogating changes in the functional properties of proteins that occur in 
      response to biological stimuli, such as viral infection. Taking dengue virus 2 (DV2) 
      infection as a model system, we utilized reactive ATP- and ADP-acyl phosphates as 
      chemical proteomic probes to detect changes in host kinase function that occur 
      within the first hour of infection. The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) was 
      discovered as a host enzyme with significantly elevated probe labeling within 60 min 
      of DV2 infection. Increased probe labeling was associated with increased DNA-PK 
      activity in nuclear lysates and localization of DNA-PK in nucleoli. These effects on 
      DNA-PK were found to require a postfusion step of DV2 entry and were recapitulated 
      by transfection of cells with RNA corresponding to stem loop B of the DV2 5' 
      untranslated region. Upon investigation of the potential downstream consequences of 
      these phenomena, we detected a modest but significant reduction in the interferon 
      response induced by DV2 in cells partially depleted of the Ku80 subunit of DNA-PK. 
      These findings identify changes in DNA-PK localization and activity as very early 
      markers of DV2 infection. More broadly, these results highlight the utility of 
      chemoproteomic profiling as a tool to detect changes in protein function associated 
      with different cell states and that may occur on very short time scales.

TI  - Dengue virus nonstructural protein NS1 binds to prothrombin/thrombin and inhibits 
      prothrombin activation.
PG  - 325-34
LID - 10.1016/j.jinf.2011.11.023 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dengue virus (DENV) infection may result in severe dengue hemorrhage 
      fever (DHF). However the mechanisms to cause hemorrhage during DENV infection are 
      not fully understood. The sera level of secreted DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) 
      is correlated with the development of DHF. However, whether secreted NS1 can 
      interfere with coagulation and contribute to the hemorrhage in DHF is unknown. Since 
      thrombin plays a very important role in the activation of coagulation, we 
      investigated whether NS1 can bind to thrombin and affect its formation or activity. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We first demonstrated that NS1 could bind to thrombin and 
      formed NS1/thrombin complex in dengue patients' sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA). The ability of NS1 binding to prothrombin or thrombin was further 
      confirmed using recombinant NS1 (rNS1) by ELISA, co-immunoprecipitation, and 
      rNS1-affinity column purification. Even though the binding of rNS1 to thrombin 
      showed no effect on thrombin activity, rNS1 could inhibit prothrombin activation and 
      prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of human platelet poor plasma. 
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest secreted DENV NS1 may bind to prothrombin and 
      inhibit it activation, which in turn, may contribute to the APTT prolongation and 
      hemorrhage in DHF patients.

AB  - Dengue virus is one of the most important arboviral pathogens and the causative 
      agent of dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. It is 
      transmitted between humans by the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, and 
      at least 2.5 billion people are at daily risk of infection. During their lifecycle, 
      mosquitoes are exposed to a variety of microbes, some of which are needed for their 
      successful development into adulthood. However, recent studies have suggested that 
      the adult mosquito's midgut microflora is critical in influencing the transmission 
      of human pathogens. In this study we assessed the reciprocal interactions between 
      the mosquito's midgut microbiota and dengue virus infection that are, to a large 
      extent, mediated by the mosquito's innate immune system. We observed a marked 
      decrease in susceptibility to dengue virus infection when mosquitoes harbored 
      certain field-derived bacterial isolates in their midgut. Transcript abundance 
      analysis of selected antimicrobial peptide genes suggested that the mosquito's 
      microbiota elicits a basal immune activity that appears to act against dengue virus 
      infection. Conversely, the elicitation of the mosquito immune response by dengue 
      virus infection itself influences the microbial load of the mosquito midgut. In sum, 
      we show that the mosquito's microbiota influences dengue virus infection of the 
      mosquito, which in turn activates its antibacterial responses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, new strategies aimed at reducing the capacity of 
      mosquito vectors to transmit dengue fever have emerged. As with earlier control 
      methods, they will have to be employed in a diverse range of communities across the 
      globe and into the main settings for disease transmission, the homes, businesses and 
      public buildings of residents in dengue-affected areas. However, these strategies 
      are notably different from previous methods and draw on technologies that are not 
      without controversy. Public engagement and authorization are critical to the future 
      success of these programs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This paper reports on an 
      Australian case study where long-term social research was used to enable 
      participation and the design of an engagement strategy tailored specifically to the 
      sociopolitical setting of a potential trial release site of Wolbachia-infected Aedes 
      aegytpi mosquitoes. Central themes of the social research, methods used and 
      conclusions drawn are briefly described. Results indicate that different communities 
      are likely to have divergent expectations, concerns and cultural sensibilities with 
      regard to participation, engagement and authorization. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The 
      findings show that a range of issues need to be understood and taken into account to 
      enable sensitive, ethical and effective engagement when seeking public support for 
      new dengue control methods.

TI  - Dengue virus type 4 in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro: the role of molecular techniques in 
      laboratory diagnosis and entomological surveillance.
PG  - 940-5
LID - S0074-02762012000700017 [pii]
AB  - In Niterói, state of Rio de Janeiro, dengue virus type 4 (DENV-4) was isolated for 
      the first time in March 2011. We analysed the laboratory findings of the first cases 
      and evaluated the use of molecular techniques for the detection of DENV-4 in Aedes 
      aegypti that were field-caught. Conventional reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) and Simplexa™ Dengue real-time RT-PCR confirmed DENV-4 infection 
      in all cases. Additionally, DENV-4 was confirmed in a female Ae. aegypti with 1.08 x 
      10(3) copies/mL of virus, as determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. This is 
      the first time the Simplexa™ Dengue real-time assay has been used for the 
      classification of cases of infection and for entomological investigations. The use 
      of these molecular techniques was shown to be important for the surveillance of 
      dengue in humans and vectors.

TI  - Identifying the effective concentration for spatial repellency of the dengue vector 
      Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 300
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-300 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current efforts are underway to quantify the chemical concentration in a 
      treated air space that elicits a spatial repellent (deterrent) response in a vector 
      population. Such information will facilitate identifying the optimum active 
      ingredient (AI) dosage and intervention coverage important for the development of 
      spatial repellent tools--one of several novel strategies being evaluated for 
      vector-borne disease control. This study reports initial findings from air sampling 
      experiments conducted under field conditions to describe the relationship between 
      air concentrations of repellent AIs and deterrent behavior in the dengue vector, 
      Aedes aegypti. METHODS: Air samples were taken inside and outdoors of experimental 
      huts located in Pu Tuey Village, Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand in conjunction with 
      mosquito behavioral evaluations. A mark-release-recapture study design using 
      interception traps was used to measure deterrency of Ae. aegypti against 0.00625% 
      metofluthrin coils and DDT-treated fabric (2g/m2) within separate experimental 
      trials. Sentinel mosquito cohorts were positioned adjacent to air sampling locations 
      to monitor knock down responses to AI within the treated air space. Air samples were 
      analyzed using two techniques: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) 
      Compendium Method TO-10A and thermal desorption (TD). RESULTS: Both the USEPA TO-10A 
      and TD air sampling methods were able to detect and quantify volatized AIs under 
      field conditions. Air samples indicated concentrations of both repellent chemicals 
      below thresholds required for toxic responses (mortality) in mosquitoes. These 
      concentrations elicited up to a 58% and 70% reduction in Ae. aegypti entry (i.e., 
      deterrency) into treated experimental huts using metofluthrin coils and DDT-treated 
      fabric, respectively. Minimal knock down was observed in sentinel mosquito cohorts 
      positioned adjacent to air sampling locations during both chemical evaluations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to describe two air sampling methodologies that 
      are appropriate for detecting and quantifying repellent chemicals within a treated 
      air space during mosquito behavior evaluations. Results demonstrate that the 
      quantity of AI detected by the mosquito vector, Ae. aegypti, that elicits repellency 
      is far lower than that needed for toxicity. These findings have important 
      implications for evaluation and optimization of new vector control tools that 
      function through mosquito behavior modification as opposed to mortality.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the transmission dynamic modeling of 
      dengue fever in subtropical Taiwan by the contributing temperature-dependent 
      entomological parameters of Aedes aegypti. A vector-host transmission model was used 
      to explore the temperature variation of pre-adult mosquito maturation, oviposition 
      rate, adult mosquito death rate, and virus incubation rate in the mosquito. 
      Sensitivity analysis, by transmissible biting rate and the initial mosquito 
      population, was adapted to observe features of the epidemic. This study showed that 
      the entomological parameter estimates are positively correlated with a gradual 
      temperature increase, but not with pre-adult mosquito maturation rate and mosquito 
      death rate, indicating the limitation of pre-adult mosquito maturation rate. Results 
      show that the temperature climate factor was indeed important and influenced the 
      dynamic modeling of the vector-host interaction. Results from our simulation also 
      suggest that the greatest risk of dengue transmission occurs at temperatures equal 
      to 28 °C. In the future, these results could be used for control measures modeling 
      and cost-effectiveness analysis.

AB  - Secondary heterologous dengue infection is a risk factor for severe disease 
      manifestations because of the immune-enhancement phenomenon. Succeeding clinical 
      infections are seldom reported, and the clinical course of tertiary and quaternary 
      dengue infections is not clear. Cuba represents a unique environment to study 
      tertiary/quaternary dengue infections in a population with known clinical and 
      serologic dengue markers and no dengue endemicity. We took advantage of this 
      exceptional epidemiologic condition to study the effect of primary, secondary, 
      tertiary, and quaternary dengue infection exposure on the expression of 
      pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines, critical in dengue infection 
      pathogenesis, by using a dengue infection ex vivo model. Whereas secondary exposure 
      induced a high cytokine response, we found a significantly lower expression of tumor 
      necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, interleukin-10, and tumor growth factor-β after 
      tertiary and quaternary infectious challenge. Significant differences in expression 
      of the cytokines were seen between the dengue immune profiles, suggesting that the 
      sequence in which the immune system encounters serotypes may be important in 
      determining the nature of the immune response to subsequent infections.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is an arthropod-borne virus (family Flaviviridae) causing dengue 
      fever or dengue hemorrhagic fever. Here, we report the first fatal DENV infection 
      imported into Germany. A female traveler was hospitalized with fever and abdominal 
      pain after returning from Ecuador. Due to a suspected acute acalculous 
      cholecystitis, cholecystectomy was performed. After cholecystectomy, severe 
      spontaneous bleeding from the abdominal wound occurred and the patient died. 
      Postmortem analysis of transudate and tissue demonstrated a DENV secondary infection 
      of the patient and a gallbladder wall thickening (GBWT) due to an extensive edema.

TI  - Trend of dengue virus infection at Lucknow, north India (2008- 2010): a hospital 
      based study.
PG  - 862-7
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Dengue virus (DV) infection has emerged as a major health 
      problem in north India. Here, we report the annual trend of dengue virus infection 
      as seen in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, during 2008-2010. METHODS: Blood samples from 
      clinically suspected cases of dengue virus infection were collected and history was 
      taken on structured clinical data sheet. All samples were tested for dengue IgM by 
      antibody capture ELISA. Selected samples were tested by conventional RT-PCR for 
      dengue virus RNA. Weather information was continuously recorded from website of 
      world weather information service . RESULTS: There was a gradual increase in number 
      of dengue fever cases with increased occurrence in 2010. Cases referred in January - 
      December 2008 were 398 (54.5% anti DV IgM positive), in January - December 2009 were 
      599 (51.9% anti DV IgM positive) and in January - December 2010 were 1602 (64.9% 
      anti DV IgM positive). Serotypes circulating in years 2008, 2009 and 2010 were DV-2 
      & DV-3, DV -1, 2 & 3 and DV-1 and DV-2 respectively. There is no statistical 
      significant correlation between weather data and increasing dengue positive cases. 
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Increased cases of dengue fever were seen in 2010, 
      which was not correlated with any change in environmental factors. A change in 
      circulating serotypes was noted.

AB  - Dengue is a disease caused by infection with one of the four dengue virus serotypes 
      (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4). The virus is transmitted to humans by Aedes sp. 
      mosquitoes. This enveloped virus contains a positive single-stranded RNA genome. 
      Clinical manifestations of dengue can have a wide range of outcomes varying from a 
      mild febrile illness to a life-threatening condition. New techniques have largely 
      replaced the use of DENV isolation in disease diagnosis. However, virus isolation 
      still serves as the gold standard for detection and serotyping of DENV and is common 
      practice in research and reference laboratories where clinical isolates of the virus 
      are characterized and sequenced, or used for a variety of research experiments. 
      Isolation of DENV from clinical samples can be achieved in mammalian and mosquito 
      cells or by inoculation of mosquitoes. The experimental methods presented here 
      describe the most common procedures used for the isolation, serotyping, propagation, 
      and quantification of DENV.

TI  - The structural basis for serotype-specific neutralization of dengue virus by a human 
      antibody.
PG  - 139ra83
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.3003888 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that affects 2.5 billion people 
      worldwide. There are four dengue serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4), and infection with one 
      elicits lifelong immunity to that serotype but offers only transient protection 
      against the other serotypes. Identification of the protective determinants of the 
      human antibody response to DENV is a vital requirement for the design and evaluation 
      of future preventative therapies and treatments. Here, we describe the isolation of 
      a neutralizing antibody from a DENV1-infected patient. The human antibody 14c10 
      (HM14c10) binds specifically to DENV1. HM14c10 neutralizes the virus principally by 
      blocking virus attachment; at higher concentrations, a post-attachment step can also 
      be inhibited. In vivo studies show that the HM14c10 antibody has antiviral activity 
      at picomolar concentrations. A 7 Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy map of Fab 
      fragments of HM14c10 in a complex with DENV1 shows targeting of a discontinuous 
      epitope that spans the adjacent surface of envelope protein dimers. As found 
      previously, a human antibody specific for the related West Nile virus binds to a 
      similar quaternary structure, suggesting that this could be an immunodominant 
      epitope. These findings provide a structural and molecular context for durable, 
      serotype-specific immunity to DENV infection.

AB  - Dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV-4) reemerged in Roraima State, Brazil, 28 years after 
      it was last detected in the country in 1982. To study the origin and evolution of 
      this reemergence, full-length sequences were obtained for 16 DENV-4 isolates from 
      northern (Roraima, Amazonas, Pará States) and northeastern (Bahia State) Brazil 
      during the 2010 and 2011 dengue virus seasons and for an isolate from the 1982 
      epidemic in Roraima. Spatiotemporal dynamics of DENV-4 introductions in Brazil were 
      applied to envelope genes and full genomes by using Bayesian phylogeographic 
      analyses. An introduction of genotype I into Brazil from Southeast Asia was 
      confirmed, and full genome phylogeographic analyses revealed multiple introductions 
      of DENV-4 genotype II in Brazil, providing evidence for >3 introductions of this 
      genotype within the last decade: 2 from Venezuela to Roraima and 1 from Colombia to 
      Amazonas. The phylogeographic analysis of full genome data has demonstrated the 
      origins of DENV-4 throughout Brazil.

LID - 10.1016/j.aca.2012.03.017 [doi]
AB  - A sensitive membrane-based electrochemical nanobiosensor is developed for the 
      detection of dengue type 2 virus (DENV-2) using nanoporous alumina-modified platinum 
      electrode. Its sensing mechanism relies on the monitoring of electrode's Faradaic 
      current response toward redox probe, ferrocenemethanol, which is sensitive toward 
      the formation of immune complexes within the alumina nanochannels. Anti-DENV-2 
      monoclonal antibody (clone 3H5, isotype IgG) is used as the biorecognition element 
      in this work. The stepwise additions of antibody, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 
      DENV-2 are characterized by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). A low detection 
      limit of 1 pfu mL(-1) with linear range from 1 to 10(3) pfu mL(-1) (R(2)=0.98) can 
      be achieved by the nanobiosensor. The nanobiosensor is selective toward DENV-2 with 
      insignificant cross reaction with non-specific viruses, Chikungunya virus, West Nile 
      virus and dengue type 3 virus (DENV-3). Relative standard deviation (RSD) for 
      triplicate analysis of 5.9% indicates an acceptable level of reproducibility. The 
      first direct quantitation of DENV-2 concentration in whole mosquito vector is 
      demonstrated using this electrochemical nanobiosensor.

AB  - Human postmortem studies of natural dengue virus (DENV) infection have reported 
      systemically distributed viral antigen. Although it is widely accepted that DENV 
      infects mononuclear phagocytes, the sequence in which specific tissues and cell 
      types are targeted remains uncharacterized. We previously reported that mice lacking 
      alpha/beta and gamma interferon receptors permit high levels of DENV replication and 
      show signs of systemic disease (T. R. Prestwood et al., J. Virol. 82:8411-8421, 
      2008). Here we demonstrate that within 6 h, DENV traffics to and replicates in both 
      CD169(+) and SIGN-R1(+) macrophages of the splenic marginal zone or draining lymph 
      node, respectively, following intravenous or intrafootpad inoculation. Subsequently, 
      high levels of replication are detected in F4/80(+) splenic red pulp macrophages and 
      in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches. Intravenously inoculated mice 
      begin to succumb to dengue disease 72 h after infection, at which time viral 
      replication occurs systemically, except in lymphoid tissues. In particular, high 
      levels of replication occur in CD68(+) macrophages of the kidneys, heart, thymus, 
      and gastrointestinal tract. Over the course of infection, proportionately large 
      quantities of DENV traffic to the liver and spleen. However, late during infection, 
      viral trafficking to the spleen decreases, while trafficking to the liver, thymus, 
      and kidneys increases. The present study demonstrates that macrophage populations, 
      initially in the spleen and other lymphoid tissues and later in nonlymphoid tissues, 
      are major targets of DENV infection in vivo.

AB  - The agents of human febrile illness can vary by region and country suggesting that 
      diagnosis, treatment, and control programs need to be based on a methodical 
      evaluation of area-specific etiologies. From December 2006 to December 2009, 9,997 
      individuals presenting with acute febrile illness at nine health care clinics in 
      south-central Cambodia were enrolled in a study to elucidate the etiologies. Upon 
      enrollment, respiratory specimens, whole blood, and serum were collected. Testing 
      was performed for viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens. Etiologies were 
      identified in 38.0% of patients. Influenza was the most frequent pathogen, followed 
      by dengue, malaria, and bacterial pathogens isolated from blood culture. In 
      addition, 3.5% of enrolled patients were infected with more than one pathogen. Our 
      data provide the first systematic assessment of the etiologies of acute febrile 
      illness in south-central Cambodia. Data from syndromic-based surveillance studies 
      can help guide public health responses in developing nations.

TI  - The relative importance of innate immune priming in Wolbachia-mediated dengue 
      interference.

AB  - The non-virulent Wolbachia strain wMel and the life-shortening strain wMelPop-CLA, 
      both originally from Drosophila melanogaster, have been stably introduced into the 
      mosquito vector of dengue fever, Aedes aegypti. Each of these Wolbachia strains 
      interferes with viral pathogenicity and/or dissemination in both their natural 
      Drosophila host and in their new mosquito host, and it has been suggested that this 
      virus interference may be due to host immune priming by Wolbachia. In order to 
      identify aspects of the mosquito immune response that might underpin virus 
      interference, we used whole-genome microarrays to analyse the transcriptional 
      response of A. aegypti to the wMel and wMelPop-CLA Wolbachia strains. While wMel 
      affected the transcription of far fewer host genes than wMelPop-CLA, both strains 
      activated the expression of some immune genes including anti-microbial peptides, 
      Toll pathway genes and genes involved in melanization. Because the induction of 
      these immune genes might be associated with the very recent introduction of 
      Wolbachia into the mosquito, we also examined the same Wolbachia strains in their 
      original host D. melanogaster. First we demonstrated that when dengue viruses were 
      injected into D. melanogaster, virus accumulation was significantly reduced in the 
      presence of Wolbachia, just as in A. aegypti. Second, when we carried out 
      transcriptional analyses of the same immune genes up-regulated in the new 
      heterologous mosquito host in response to Wolbachia we found no over-expression of 
      these genes in D. melanogaster, infected with either wMel or wMelPop. These results 
      reinforce the idea that the fundamental mechanism involved in viral interference in 
      Drosophila and Aedes is not dependent on the up-regulation of the immune effectors 
      examined, although it cannot be excluded that immune priming in the heterologous 
      mosquito host might enhance the virus interference trait.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia, bleeding and plasma leakage are cardinal features of 
      severe dengue. Endothelial cell activation with exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies 
      (WPBs) may play an etiological role in this condition. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: In a cohort of 73 Indonesian children with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), 
      of which 30 with dengue shock syndrome (DSS), we measured plasma levels of the WPB 
      constituents von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF propeptide and 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG), together with activity levels of the VWF-cleaving enzyme 
      ADAMTS-13 and the amount of VWF in a platelet binding conformation (VWF activation 
      factor). Compared with healthy controls (n = 17), children with DHF/DSS had 
      significantly higher levels of VWF:Ag, VWF propeptide and OPG and decreased 
      ADAMTS-13 activity. The VWF activation factor was also significantly higher in 
      DHF/DSS and highest in children who died. There were significant differences in the 
      kinetics of the various WPB constituents: VWF propeptide and OPG levels decreased 
      toward discharge, while VWF:Ag levels were lower than expected at enrollment with 
      plasma levels increasing toward discharge. Moreover, VWF propeptide levels 
      correlated better with markers of disease severity (platelet count, liver enzymes, 
      serum albumin and pleural effusion index) than corresponding VWF levels. Together, 
      these findings suggest that there is consumption of VWF in DHF/DSS. In 4 out of 15 
      selected children with low ADAMTS-13 levels on admission, we found a remarkable 
      reduction in the large and intermediate VWF multimers in the discharge blood 
      samples, consistent with an acquired von Willebrand disease. CONCLUSION: These 
      findings suggest that severe dengue is associated with exocytosis of WPBs with 
      increased circulating levels of VWF:Ag, VWF propeptide and OPG. High circulating 
      levels of VWF in its active conformation, together with low ADAMTS-13 activity 
      levels, are likely to contribute to the thrombocytopenia and complications of 
      dengue. During the convalescence phase, qualitative defects in VWF with loss of 
      larger VWF multimers may develop.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the quality of dengue-related health 
      information on the Internet. Three raters used the keyword dengue to search the 
      Google, Yahoo!, and Bing search engines during August 2011. The first 20 websites 
      from each search engine were examined for a total of 60 sites. Duplicate, 
      nonfunctional, non-English, and nonoperational websites were excluded from the 
      study, resulting in 36 sites for final analysis. The 16-item DISCERN tool was used 
      to evaluate the quality of dengue-related health information on the Internet. 
      Chi-square analysis and analysis of variance were performed to compare the DISCERN 
      scores. Inter-rater reliability analysis showed significant differences in the level 
      of agreement among the three raters. The 36 unique websites were categorized into 
      .com, .edu, .gov, .org, and other sites. The .com sites had the lowest DISCERN 
      scores. Educating consumers on how to find and recognize valid health information on 
      the Internet may lead to better informed decision making.

AB  - There is an urgent need for potent inhibitors of dengue virus (DENV) replication for 
      the treatment and/or prophylaxis of infections with this virus. We here report on an 
      aglycon analogue of the antibiotic teicoplanin (code name LCTA-949) that inhibits 
      DENV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in a dose-dependent manner. Virus infection was 
      completely inhibited at concentrations that had no adverse effect on the host cells. 
      These findings were corroborated by quantification of viral RNA levels in culture 
      supernatant. Antiviral activity was also observed against other flaviviruses such as 
      the yellow fever virus and the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). In particular, 
      potent antiviral activity was observed against TBEV. Time-of-drug-addition 
      experiments indicated that LCTA-949 inhibits an early stage in the DENV replication 
      cycle; however, a virucidal effect was excluded. This observation was corroborated 
      by the fact that LCTA-949 lacks activity on DENV subgenomic replicon (that does not 
      encode structural proteins) replication. Using a microsopy-based binding and fusion 
      assay employing DiD-labeled viruses, it was shown that LCTA-949 targets the early 
      stage (binding/entry) of the infection. Moreover, LCTA-949 efficiently inhibits 
      infectivity of DENV particles pre-opsonized with antibodies, thus potentially also 
      inhibiting antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In conclusion, LCTA-949 exerts in 
      vitro activity against several flaviviruses and does so (as shown for DENV) by 
      interfering with an early step in the viral replication cycle.

TI  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever in Trinidad and Tobago: a case for a conservative approach 
      to platelet transfusion.
PG  - 531-5
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.10-0209 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever is endemic to Trinidad and Tobago. A retrospective analysis of all 
      adult admissions at a tertiary hospital in Trinidad treated for dengue during 
      January 1-December 31, 2008 was performed. A total of 186 patients were treated 
      during this period: 98.9% (184) of the patients were thrombocytopenic; 45.2% were 
      severely thrombocytopenic; 13 patients showed development of minor hemorrhage and 
      only one case of major hemorrhage; platelet transfusion was given for 7% (13) of the 
      cases; and 6 cases for which platelet transfusion was given did not show evidence of 
      plasma leakage (12 of these cases did not show evidence of hemorrhage). There was a 
      strong association between the lowest platelet value and hemoconcentration (χ(2) = 
      13.16, P < 0.025). No association was found between giving a platelet transfusion 
      and hemoconcentration or hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia seen in dengue resolves 
      spontaneously and independent of any transfusion used.

TI  - Genome-wide patterns of intrahuman dengue virus diversity reveal associations with 
      viral phylogenetic clade and interhost diversity.
PG  - 8546-58
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00736-12 [doi]
AB  - Analogous to observations in RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, 
      genetic variation associated with intrahost dengue virus (DENV) populations has been 
      postulated to influence viral fitness and disease pathogenesis. Previous attempts to 
      investigate intrahost genetic variation in DENV characterized only a few viral genes 
      or a limited number of full-length genomes. We developed a whole-genome 
      amplification approach coupled with deep sequencing to capture intrahost diversity 
      across the entire coding region of DENV-2. Using this approach, we sequenced DENV-2 
      genomes from the serum of 22 Nicaraguan individuals with secondary DENV infection 
      and captured ∼75% of the DENV genome in each sample (range, 40 to 98%). We 
      identified and quantified variants using a highly sensitive and specific method and 
      determined that the extent of diversity was considerably lower than previous 
      estimates. Significant differences in intrahost diversity were detected between 
      genes and also between antigenically distinct domains of the Envelope gene. 
      Interestingly, a strong association was discerned between the extent of intrahost 
      diversity in a few genes and viral clade identity. Additionally, the abundance of 
      viral variants within a host, as well as the impact of viral mutations on amino acid 
      encoding and predicted protein function, determined whether intrahost variants were 
      observed at the interhost level in circulating Nicaraguan DENV-2 populations, 
      strongly suggestive of purifying selection across transmission events. Our data 
      illustrate the value of high-coverage genome-wide analysis of intrahost diversity 
      for high-resolution mapping of the relationship between intrahost diversity and 
      clinical, epidemiological, and virological parameters of viral infection.

TI  - Cytokine expression profile of dengue patients at different phases of illness.
PG  - e52215

LID - e52215
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is an important medical problem, with symptoms ranging from mild 
      dengue fever to severe forms of the disease, where vascular leakage leads to 
      hypovolemic shock. Cytokines have been implicated to play a role in the progression 
      of severe dengue disease; however, their profile in dengue patients and the synergy 
      that leads to continued plasma leakage is not clearly understood. Herein, we 
      investigated the cytokine kinetics and profiles of dengue patients at different 
      phases of illness to further understand the role of cytokines in dengue disease. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Circulating levels of 29 different types of cytokines were 
      assessed by bead-based ELISA method in dengue patients at the 3 different phases of 
      illness. The association between significant changes in the levels of cytokines and 
      clinical parameters were analyzed. At the febrile phase, IP-10 was significant in 
      dengue patients with and without warning signs. However, MIP-1β was found to be 
      significant in only patients with warning signs at this phase. IP-10 was also 
      significant in both with and without warning signs patients during defervescence. At 
      this phase, MIP-1β and G-CSF were significant in patients without warning signs, 
      whereas MCP-1 was noted to be elevated significantly in patients with warning signs. 
      Significant correlations between the levels of VEGF, RANTES, IL-7, IL-12, PDGF and 
      IL-5 with platelets; VEGF with lymphocytes and neutrophils; G-CSF and IP-10 with 
      atypical lymphocytes and various other cytokines with the liver enzymes were 
      observed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The cytokine profile patterns discovered 
      between the different phases of illness indicate an essential role in dengue 
      pathogenesis and with further studies may serve as predictive markers for 
      progression to dengue with warning signs.

AB  - The Dengue National Control Program was established in Cambodia in 2000 and has 
      reported between 10,000 and 40,000 dengue cases per year with a case fatality rate 
      ranging from 0.7 to 1.7. In this study 39 DENV-2 and 57 DENV-3 viruses isolated from 
      patients between 2000 and 2008 were fully sequenced. Five DENV2 and four DENV3 
      distinct lineages with different dynamics were identified. Each lineage was 
      characterized by the presence of specific mutations with no evidence of 
      recombination. In both DENV-2 and DENV-3 the lineages present prior to 2003 were 
      replaced after that date by unrelated lineages. After 2003, DENV-2 lineages D2-3 and 
      D2-4 cocirculated until 2007 when they were almost completely replaced by a lineage 
      D2-5 which emerged from D2-3 Conversely, all DENV-3 lineages remained, diversified 
      and cocirculated with novel lineages emerging. Years 2006 and 2007 were marked by a 
      high prevalence of DENV-3 and 2007 with a large dengue outbreak and a high 
      proportion of patients with severe disease. Selective sweeps in DENV-1 and DENV-2 
      were linked to immunological escape to a predominately DENV-3-driven immunological 
      response. The complex dynamic of dengue in Cambodia in the last ten years has been 
      associated with a combination of stochastic climatic events, cocirculation, 
      coevolution, adaptation to different vector populations, and with the human 
      population immunological landscape.

TI  - Synergistic larvicidal effect and morphological alterations induced by ethanolic 
      extracts of Annona muricata and Piper nigrum against the dengue fever vector Aedes 
      aegypti.
PG  - 589-601
LID - 10.1002/ps.3409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phytopesticide combinations of different botanical sources are seldom 
      reported. Annona muricata seed and Piper nigrum fruit ethanolic extracts enriched in 
      acetogenins and piperamides, respectively, were synergistically used as larvicides 
      against the dengue fever vector Aedes aegypti. RESULTS: Individual bioassays of A. 
      muricata and P. nigrum indicated respective LC50 values of 93.48 and 1.84 µg mL(-1) 
      against third-instar larvae. Five combinations of different proportions of plant 
      extracts pointed to synergism between the extracts. The best A. muricata:P. nigrum 
      extract combination was 90:10, which showed 5.12 times the amount of synergism, as 
      confirmed by statistical equations and total concentration log versus combination 
      proportions. Concerning the morphology, A. muricata caused larvae body elongation, 
      mainly in the abdomen, along with the appearance of a cervix. Conversely, P. nigrum 
      induced abdomen and whole body shortening. The morphological effects of A. muricata 
      were prevalent in all of the combinations tested, irrespective of its proportion in 
      the combination. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the different mechanisms of action 
      of the larvicidal actives A. muricata acetogenins and P. nigrum piperamides explain 
      the observed synergism. The combination of inexpensive botanicals and a low-cost 
      organosolvent such as ethanol leads to a simple and efficient phytolarvicidal 
      formulation.

TI  - Detection of Chikungunya virus in Aedes aegypti during 2011 outbreak in Al Hodayda, 
      Yemen.
PG  - 62-6
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.03.004 [doi]
AB  - In October 2010, the Ministry of Public Health and Population reported an outbreak 
      of dengue-like acute febrile illness in Al Hodayda governorate. By January 2011, a 
      total of 1542 cases had been recorded from 19 of the 26 districts in the governorate 
      with 104 purportedly associated deaths. In response this event, in January 2011 
      entomological investigations aimed at identifying the primary vector and the 
      epidemic associated etiological agent were carried out. Based on the reported cases 
      and the progress of the outbreak in the governorate, mosquito collection was 
      undertaken in two of the most recent outbreak areas; Al Khokha district (130km south 
      of Al Hodayda) and Al Muneera district (100km north). Mosquito adults were collected 
      from houses using BG-sentinel™ traps, aspiration of resting mosquitoes and 
      knock-down spraying. Indoor and outdoor containers adjacent to the houses were 
      inspected for larvae. Subsequently mosquito pools were analyzed by RT-PCR for 
      detection of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4), and 
      for Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Aedes aegypti was the dominant mosquito species 
      collected. Four pools represent 40% of the tested pools, all containing adult female 
      Ae. aegypti, were positive for CHIKV. Three CHIKV isolates were obtained from the 
      RNA positive mosquito pools and identified by rRT-PCR. This finding marks the first 
      record of CHIKV isolated from Ae. aegypti in Yemen. The larval container and Breteau 
      indices in the visited localities surveyed were estimated at 53.8 and 100, 
      respectively. The emergence of this unprecedented CHIKV epidemic in Al Hodayda is 
      adding up another arboviral burden to the already existing vector-borne diseases. 
      Considering the governorate as one focal port in the Red Sea region, the spread of 
      the disease to other areas in Yemen and in neighboring countries is anticipated. 
      Public health education and simple measures to detect and prevent mosquito breeding 
      in water storage containers could prevent and reduce the spread of mosquito-borne 
      viruses like CHIKV and DENV in Yemen.

AB  - High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is released from cells as a 
      pro-inflammatory cytokine in response to an injury or infection. During dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS), a number of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines are released, contributing to disease pathogenesis. In this study, the 
      release of HMGB1 from human myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 and primary 
      peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) cells was examined during dengue virus 
      (DV)-infection. HMGB1 was shown to translocate from cell nuclei to the cytoplasm in 
      both K562- and PBM-infected cells. The translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to 
      the cytoplasm was shown to be mediated by the host cell p300/CBP-associated factor 
      (PCAF) acetylase complex in K562 cells. In addition, DV capsid protein was observed 
      to be the putative viral protein in actuating HMGB1 migration from the nucleus to 
      cytoplasm through the involvement of PCAF acetylase. HMGB1 was released from 
      DV-infected K562 cells into the extracellular milieu in a multiplicity of infection 
      (M.O.I.)-independent manner and its release can be inhibited by the addition of 1-5 
      mM of ethyl pyruvate (EP) in a dose-dependent manner. Application of DV-infected 
      K562 cell culture supernatants to primary endothelial cells induced vascular 
      permeability. In contrast, supernatants from DV-infected K562 cells treated with EP 
      or HMGB1 neutralizing antibody were observed to maintain the structural integrity of 
      the vascular barrier.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Altered plasma concentrations of vitamin D and mannose binding lectin 
      (MBL), components of innate immunity, have been shown to be associated with the 
      pathogenesis of viral infections. The objective of the present study was to find out 
      whether plasma concentrations of MBL and vitamin D are different in patients with 
      dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). THE RESULTS: The plasma 
      concentrations of vitamin D and MBL were assessed in 48 DF cases, 45 DHF cases and 
      20 apparently healthy controls using ELISA based methods. Vitamin D concentrations 
      were found to be higher among both DF and DHF cases as compared to healthy controls 
      (P < 0.005 and P < 0.001). Vitamin D concentrations were not different between DF 
      and DHF cases. When the dengue cases were classified into primary and secondary 
      infections, secondary DHF cases had significantly higher concentrations of vitamin D 
      as compared to secondary DF cases (P < 0.050). MBL concentrations were not 
      significantly different between healthy controls and dengue cases. MBL 
      concentrations were observed to be lower in DHF cases as compared to DF cases 
      (P < 0.050). Although MBL levels were not different DF and DHF cases based on immune 
      status, the percentage of primary DHF cases (50%) having MBL levels lower than 
      500 ng/ml were less compared to primary DF cases (P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      present study suggests that higher concentrations of vitamin D might be associated 
      with secondary DHF while deficiency of MBL may be associated with primary DHF.

AB  - Recombinant fusion protein containing domain III of the dengue envelope protein 
      fused to capsid protein from dengue 2 virus was immunogenic and conferred protection 
      in mice against lethal challenge in previously report. Here, the antigenic 
      specificity of this recombinant protein using anti-dengue antibodies from mice and 
      humans and the cross-reactive humoral and cellular response induced in immunized 
      mice were evaluated. The homologous anti-dengue antibodies showed a higher 
      reactivity to the recombinant protein compared to the wide cross-reactivity observed 
      for viral antigen as determined by ELISA. The IgG anti-dengue and functional 
      antibodies, induced by the recombinant proteins in mice, were highly serotype 
      specific by ELISA, hemaglutination inhibition and plaque reduction neutralizing 
      tests. Accordingly, the cellular immune response determined by the IFNγ and TNFα 
      secretion, was serotype specific. The specificity of serotype associated to this 
      recombinant protein in addition to its high antigenicity, immunogenicity and 
      protecting capacity suggest its advantage as a possible functional and safe vaccine 
      candidate against dengue in a future tetravalent formulation.

AB  - Dengue fever outbreaks are reported from India since last 10 years. Since 2005, 
      chikungunya is also causing massive outbreaks in India and other parts of Asia. Both 
      viruses are transmitted by aedes genus and both viruses can re-emerge in many 
      regions due to climatic changes. The clinical presentation of both arthropod borne 
      diseases are similar. Here a concomitant infection of chikungunya and dengue is 
      reported in an 8-year-old child.

TI  - Evaluation of a sticky trap (AedesTraP), made from disposable plastic bottles, as a 
      monitoring tool for Aedes aegypti populations.
PG  - 195
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus, which is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is the 
      most important emerging viral disease, infecting more than 50 million people 
      annually. Currently used sticky traps are useful tools for monitoring and control of 
      A. aegypti, despite differences in efficiency, labor requirements and cost. In the 
      present work, a field assay was carried out to evaluate the performance of a sticky 
      trap (AedesTrap), produced using disposable material, in capturing gravid Aedes spp. 
      females. Additionally, conditions necessary for the improved performance of the 
      device, such as number of traps per site and location (indoors or outdoors) were 
      evaluated. METHODS: During a one year period, traps were placed in a dengue endemic 
      area in 28 day cycles. The trap, named AedesTrap, consisted of a disposable plastic 
      soda bottle coated inside with colophony resin, which served as a sticky substrate. 
      Disposable bottles were donated by restaurants, and traps were made by laboratory 
      staff, reducing the cost of the sticky trap (less than U$3). Mosquito capture in 
      indoor and outdoor areas was compared by placing the traps in laundry room, kitchen 
      or bedroom (indoors) and front or back yard (outdoors). The relationship between the 
      number of AedesTraps and quantity of captured mosquitoes was investigated by 
      utilizing one or three traps/site. RESULTS: During a 28 day cycle, a single 
      AedesTrap was capable of capturing up to 15 A. aegypti in a house, with a mean 
      capture of 0.5 to 2.63 females per premise. The AedesTrap collected three times more 
      outdoors versus indoors. Similarly, the capability of detecting Aedes spp. 
      infestation, and of capturing females, was three times higher when using three 
      AedesTraps per house, compared with one trap per house. CONCLUSIONS: AedesTrap was 
      shown to be capable of capturing A. aegypti and other culicidae, providing 
      information on the adult mosquito population, and allowing the identification of 
      areas critically infested by mosquitoes. Low requirements for skilled labor together 
      with easy maintenance and low cost are additional advantages of using this sticky 
      trap.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To access the costs of standard indoor ultra-low-volume (SID-ULV) space 
      spraying for controlling dengue vectors in Thailand. METHODS: Resources related to 
      SID-ULV space spraying as a method to control dengue vectors between July and 
      December 2009 were identified, measured and valued taking a societal perspective 
      into consideration. Information on costs was collected from direct observations, 
      interviews and bookkeeping records. Uncertainty of unit costs was investigated using 
      a bootstrap technique. RESULTS: Costs of SID-ULV were calculated from 18 new dengue 
      cases that covered 1492 surrounding houses. The average coverage of the SID-ULV was 
      64.4%. In the first round of spraying, 53% of target houses were sprayed and 44.6% 
      in the second round, of which 69.2% and 54.7% received entire indoor space spraying. 
      Unit costs per case, per 10 houses and per 100 m(2) were USD 705 (95% Confidence 
      Interval CI, 539-888), 180 (95% CI, 150-212) and USD 23 (95% CI, 17-30). The 
      majority of SID-ULV unit cost per case was attributed to productivity loss (83.9%) 
      and recurrent costs (15.2%). The unit cost of the SID-ULV per case and per house in 
      rural was 2.8 and 1.6 times lower than municipal area. The estimated annual cost of 
      SID-ULV space spraying from 2005 to 2009 using healthcare perspective ranged from 
      USD 5.3 to 10.3 million. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the cost of SID-ULV space 
      spraying was attributed to productivity loss. Potential productivity loss influences 
      the achievement of high coverage, so well-planned SID-ULV space spraying strategies 
      are needed to reduce costs.

TI  - Notes from the field: investigation of leptospirosis underreporting - Puerto Rico, 
      2010.
PG  - 421
AB  - Leptospirosis, a zoonosis transmitted through contact with the urine of infected 
      animals, either directly or through exposure to contaminated water or soil, is a 
      frequent cause of acute febrile illness (AFI) and can be difficult to distinguish 
      from dengue in areas where both are endemic. Approximately 5%-10% of patients with 
      leptospirosis are affected severely; the case-fatality rate in those with severe 
      disease is 5%-15%. Early identification of leptospirosis cases and early 
      administration of penicillin G or doxycycline can reduce the duration and severity 
      of illness.

TI  - A novel inhibitor of dengue virus replication that targets the capsid protein.
PG  - 15-25
LID - 10.1128/AAC.01429-12 [doi]
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) infect 50 to 100 million people worldwide per year, of which 
      500,000 develop severe life-threatening disease. This mosquito-borne illness is 
      endemic in most tropical and subtropical countries and has spread significantly over 
      the last decade. While there are several promising vaccine candidates in clinical 
      trials, there are currently no approved vaccines or therapeutics available for 
      treatment of dengue infection. Here, we describe a novel small-molecule compound, 
      ST-148, that is a potent inhibitor of all four serotypes of DENV in vitro. ST-148 
      significantly reduced viremia and viral load in vital organs and tended to lower 
      cytokine levels in the plasma in a nonlethal model of DENV infection in AG129 mice. 
      Compound resistance mapped to the DENV capsid (C) gene, and a direct interaction of 
      ST-148 with C protein is suggested by alterations of the intrinsic fluorescence of 
      the protein in the presence of compound. Thus, ST-148 appears to interact with the 
      DENV C protein and inhibits a distinct step(s) of the viral replication cycle.

TI  - Dengue virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes target NS1, NS3 and NS5 in 
      infected Indian rhesus macaques.

AB  - Every year, Dengue virus (DENV) infects approximately 100 million people. There are 
      currently several vaccines undergoing clinical studies, but most target the 
      induction of neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, DENV infection can be enhanced 
      by subneutralizing levels of antibodies that bind virions and deliver them to cells 
      of the myeloid lineage, thereby increasing viral replication (termed 
      antibody-dependent enhancement [ADE]). T lymphocyte-based vaccines may offer an 
      alternative that avoids ADE. The goal of our study was to describe the cellular 
      immune response generated after primary DENV infection in Indian rhesus macaques. We 
      infected eight rhesus macaques with 10⁵ plaque-forming units (PFU) of DENV serotype 
      2 (DENV2) New Guinea C (NGC) strain, and monitored viral load and the cellular 
      immune response to the virus. Viral replication peaked at day 4 post-infection and 
      was resolved by day 10. DENV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes targeted 
      nonstructural (NS) 1, NS3 and NS5 proteins after resolution of peak viremia. 
      DENV-specific CD4+ cells expressed interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) along with tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and macrophage inflammatory 
      protein-1 beta (MIP-1β). In comparison, DENV-specific CD8+ cells expressed IFN-γ in 
      addition to MIP-1β and TNF-α and were positive for the degranulation marker CD107a. 
      Interestingly, a fraction of the DENV-specific CD4+ cells also stained for CD107a, 
      suggesting that they might be cytotoxic. Our results provide a more complete 
      understanding of the cellular immune response during DENV infection in rhesus 
      macaques and contribute to the development of rhesus macaques as an animal model for 
      DENV vaccine and pathogenicity studies.

TI  - The stem region of premembrane protein plays an important role in the virus surface 
      protein rearrangement during dengue maturation.
PG  - 40525-34
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.384446 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus surface proteins, envelope (E) and pre-membrane (prM), 
      undergo rearrangement during the maturation process at acidic condition. RESULTS: 
      prM-stem region binds tighter to both E protein and lipid membrane when environment 
      becomes acidic. CONCLUSION: At acidic condition, E proteins are attracted to the 
      membrane-associated prM-stem. SIGNIFICANCE: prM-stem region induces virus structural 
      changes during maturation. Newly assembled dengue viruses (DENV) undergo maturation 
      to become infectious particles. The maturation process involves major rearrangement 
      of virus surface premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins. The prM-E complexes on 
      immature viruses are first assembled as trimeric spikes in the neutral pH 
      environment of the endoplasmic reticulum. When the virus is transported to the low 
      pH environment of the exosomes, these spikes rearrange into dimeric structures, 
      which lie parallel to the virus lipid envelope. The proteins involved in driving 
      this process are unknown. Previous cryoelectron microscopy studies of the mature 
      DENV showed that the prM-stem region (residues 111-131) is membrane-associated and 
      may interact with the E proteins. Here we investigated the prM-stem region in 
      modulating the virus maturation process. The binding of the prM-stem region to the E 
      protein was shown to increase significantly at low pH compared with neutral pH in 
      ELISAs and surface plasmon resonance studies. In addition, the affinity of the 
      prM-stem region for the liposome, as measured by fluorescence correlation 
      spectroscopy, was also increased when pH is lowered. These results suggest that the 
      prM-stem region forms a tight association with the virus membrane and attracts the 
      associated E protein in the low pH environment of exosomes. This will lead to the 
      surface protein rearrangement observed during maturation.

AB  - Malaria and dengue are important problems in Japan particularly since international 
      travel to developing countries has become increasingly popular. To describe the 
      clinical features of malaria and dengue cases in Japan, a retrospective study was 
      conducted on 50 malaria cases and 40 dengue cases presented to the National Centre 
      for Global Health and Medicine of Japan between 2005 and 2010. The most frequent 
      area of acquisition for cases of malaria was Africa (76.0%), and for dengue fever 
      was Asia (90.0%). Although the immigrant population is very small in Japan, patients 
      categorized as visiting friends and relatives were relatively high in proportion, 
      which is similar to Western reports. Confirmed cases of malaria and dengue account 
      for less than 10% of the all travelers returning with any health problems according 
      to the National Centre for Global Health and Medicine. Careful observation of 
      symptoms and signs helps the differential diagnosis of malaria and dengue.

      disease severity.
PG  - 15-22

AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV; family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) are transmitted by 
      Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and can cause dengue fever (DF), a relatively benign 
      disease, or more severe dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Arthropod saliva contains 
      proteins delivered into the bite wound that can modulate the host haemostatic and 
      immune responses to facilitate the intake of a blood meal. The potential effects on 
      DENV infection of previous exposure to Ae. aegypti salivary proteins have not been 
      investigated. We collected Ae. aegypti saliva, concentrated the proteins and 
      fractionated them by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). By the 
      use of immunoblots, we analysed reactivity with the mosquito salivary proteins (MSP) 
      of sera from 96 Thai children diagnosed with secondary DENV infections leading 
      either to DF or DHF, or with no DENV infection, and found that different proportions 
      of each patient group had serum antibodies reactive to specific Ae. aegypti salivary 
      proteins. Our results suggest that prior exposure to MSP might play a role in the 
      outcome of DENV infection in humans.

TI  - Potential impacts of climate variability on dengue hemorrhagic fever in Honduras, 
      2010.
PG  - 499-507
AB  - Climate change and variability are affecting human health and disease direct or 
      indirectly through many mechanisms. Dengue is one of those diseases that is strongly 
      influenced by climate variability; however its study in Central America has been 
      poorly approached. In this study, we assessed potential associations between 
      macroclimatic and microclimatic variation and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases 
      in the main hospital of Honduras during 2010. In this year, 3,353 cases of DHF were 
      reported in the Hospital Escuela, Tegucigalpa. Climatic periods marked a difference 
      of 158% in the mean incidence of cases, from El Niño weeks (-99% of cases below the 
      mean incidence) to La Niña months (+59% of cases above it) (p<0.01). Linear 
      regression showed significantly higher dengue incidence with lower values of Oceanic 
      Niño Index (p=0.0097), higher rain probability (p=0.0149), accumulated rain 
      (p=0.0443) and higher relative humidity (p=0.0292). At a multiple linear regression 
      model using those variables, ONI values shown to be the most important and 
      significant factor found to be associated with the monthly occurrence of DHF cases 
      (r²=0.649; βstandardized=-0.836; p=0.01). As has been shown herein, climate 
      variability is an important element influencing the dengue epidemiology in Honduras. 
      However, it is necessary to extend these studies in this and other countries in the 
      Central America region, because these models can be applied for surveillance as well 
      as for prediction of dengue.

AB  - Seven commercial assays were evaluated to determine their suitability for the 
      diagnosis of acute dengue infection: (i) the Panbio dengue virus Pan-E NS1 early 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), second generation (Alere, Australia); 
      (ii) the Panbio dengue virus IgM capture ELISA (Alere, Australia); (iii) the Panbio 
      dengue virus IgG capture ELISA (Alere, Australia); (iv) the Standard Diagnostics 
      dengue virus NS1 antigen ELISA (Standard Diagnostics, South Korea); (v) the Standard 
      Diagnostics dengue virus IgM ELISA (Standard Diagnostics, South Korea); (vi) the 
      Standard Diagnostics dengue virus IgG ELISA (Standard Diagnostics, South Korea); and 
      (vii) the Platelia NS1 antigen ELISA (Bio-Rad, France). Samples from 239 Thai 
      patients confirmed to be dengue virus positive and 98 Sri Lankan patients negative 
      for dengue virus infection were tested. The sensitivities and specificities of the 
      NS1 antigen ELISAs ranged from 45 to 57% and 93 to 100% and those of the IgM 
      antibody ELISAs ranged from 85 to 89% and 88 to 100%, respectively. Combining the 
      NS1 antigen and IgM antibody results from the Standard Diagnostics ELISAs gave the 
      best compromise between sensitivity and specificity (87 and 96%, respectively), as 
      well as providing the best sensitivity for patients presenting at different times 
      after fever onset. The Panbio IgG capture ELISA correctly classified 67% of 
      secondary dengue infection cases. This study provides strong evidence of the value 
      of combining dengue virus antigen- and antibody-based test results in the ELISA 
      format for the diagnosis of acute dengue infection.

AB  - Vector-borne diseases represent a major public health concern in most tropical and 
      subtropical areas, and an emerging threat for more developed countries. Our 
      understanding of the ecology, evolution and control of these diseases relies 
      predominantly on theory and data on pathogen transmission in large self-sustaining 
      'source' populations of vectors representative of highly endemic areas. However, 
      there are numerous places where environmental conditions are less favourable to 
      vector populations, but where immigration allows them to persist. We built an 
      epidemiological model to investigate the dynamics of six major human vector 
      borne-diseases in such non self-sustaining 'sink' vector populations. The model was 
      parameterized through a review of the literature, and we performed extensive 
      sensitivity analysis to look at the emergence and prevalence of the pathogen that 
      could be encountered in these populations. Despite the low vector abundance in 
      typical sink populations, all six human diseases were able to spread in 15-55% of 
      cases after accidental introduction. The rate of spread was much more strongly 
      influenced by vector longevity, immigration and feeding rates, than by transmission 
      and virulence of the pathogen. Prevalence in humans remained lower than 5% for 
      dengue, leishmaniasis and Japanese encephalitis, but substantially higher for 
      diseases with longer duration of infection; malaria and the American and African 
      trypanosomiasis. Vector-related parameters were again the key factors, although 
      their influence was lower than on pathogen emergence. Our results emphasize the need 
      for ecology and evolution to be thought in the context of metapopulations made of a 
      mosaic of sink and source habitats, and to design vector control program not only 
      targeting areas of high vector density, but working at a larger spatial scale.

AB  - To investigate the adjuvant effect of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating 
      factor (GM-CSF) in Flaviviridae virus DNA vaccines. After DNA immunization, the 
      antibody levels of serum from mice were detected by ELISA and indirect 
      immunofluorescence assay. Co-immunization of GM-CSF suppressed the immune responses 
      induced by DV1 and DV2 candidate vaccines whereas enhanced the immune response 
      induced by HCV C and E1 DNA vaccines. As genetic adjuvant for DNA vaccines, GM-CSF 
      might display complex diversity on the immune responses: an augmentation or 
      suppression due to different immunogens. Therefore, GM-CSF should be used with some 
      cautions in clinic.

TI  - Dengue virus inactivation by minipool TnBP/Triton X-45 treatment of plasma and 
      cryoprecipitate.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1423-0410.2012.01621.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A minipool solvent/detergent (S/D; 1% TnBP/1% Triton 
      X-45; 31°C) process was developed for viral inactivation of plasma and 
      cryoprecipitate used for transfusion. The goal of this study was to determine the 
      rate and extent of inactivation of dengue virus (DENV) during this process. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: DENV-1 was propagated using C6/36 mosquito cells to an 
      infectivity titre close to 9 log and spiked (10% v/v) into individual plasma and 
      cryoprecipitate samples from two distinct donors. Samples were taken right after 
      spiking and during viral inactivation treatment by 1% TnBP-1% Triton X-45 at 31°C. 
      DENV-1 infectivity was assessed on Vero E6 cells by a focus-forming assay (FFA). 
      Culture medium and complement-inactivated plasma were used as experimental controls. 
      Experiments were done in duplicate. RESULTS: DENV-1 infectivity was 7·5 log in 
      spiked plasma and 7·1 and 7·3 log in spiked cryoprecipitate. There was no loss of 
      DENV-1 infectivity in the spiked materials, nor in the controls not subjected to S/D 
      treatment. No infectivity was found in plasma and cryoprecipitate subjected to S/D 
      treatment at the first time-point evaluated (10 min). CONCLUSION: DENV-1 was 
      strongly inactivated in plasma and cryoprecipitate, respectively, within 10 min of 
      1% TnBP/1% Triton X-45 treatment at 31°C. These data provide a reassurance of the 
      safety of such S/D-treated plasma and cryoprecipitate with regard to the risk of 
      transmission of all DENV serotypes and other flaviviruses.

TI  - Purified and highly aggregated chimeric protein DIIIC-2 induces a functional immune 
      response in mice against dengue 2 virus.
PG  - 225-30
LID - 10.1007/s00705-012-1471-z [doi]
AB  - It was previously reported that DIIIC-2 (a fusion protein composed of domain III of 
      the envelope protein and the capsid protein from dengue 2 virus), as an aggregate 
      antigen from a partially purified preparation, induced a functional protective 
      immune response against dengue 2 virus in the mouse encephalitis model. In the 
      present work, a purification procedure was developed for DIIIC-2, and soluble and 
      aggregated fractions of the purified protein were characterized and evaluated in 
      mice. The purification process rendered a protein preparation of 91 % purity, and 
      the remaining 9 % consisted of fragments and aggregates of the same recombinant 
      protein. After the in vitro aggregation process, upon addition of 
      oligodeoxynucleotides, 80 % of the protein formed aggregates, whereas 20 % remained 
      as soluble protein. An immunological evaluation revealed the proper immunogenicity 
      of the aggregated purified protein in terms of induction of antiviral and 
      neutralizing antibodies, cell-mediated immunity and protection upon dengue 2 virus 
      challenge in the mouse encephalitis model. Based on these results, we can assert 
      that the purified protein DIIIC-2 is functional and could be used for further 
      scalable steps and preclinical studies in non-human primates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Members of New Zealand Police (NZP) deploy overseas in a variety of 
      roles. There is limited published data on travel-related morbidity in police as a 
      subgroup of travelers. METHODS: An audit of pre- and postdeployment medical files 
      for all NZP personnel deploying overseas during 2004 to 2010 was undertaken. Of all 
      deployments, 58.9% were within Oceania. RESULTS: Positive Strongyloides stercoralis 
      serology was returned in 6.07% (95% CI: 3.80%-9.13%) at a rate of 9.00/1,000 person 
      deployment months (pdm) (95% CI: 5.57-13.8). Dengue fever seroconversion was 
      recorded in 4.91% (95% CI: 3.40%-6.83%) at a rate of 8.57/1,000 pdm (95% CI: 
      5.90-12.0). The relative risk of dengue infection was 7.47 for Timor Leste compared 
      to all other deployment destinations. An association between seroconverting for both 
      dengue fever and Strongyloides was found. Tuberculosis conversion was recorded in 
      1.76% (95% CI: 0.85%-3.21%) at a rate of 2.92/1,000 pmd (95% CI: 1.48-5.375). A 
      single case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion was recorded. There 
      were no recorded hepatitis C seroconversions. CONCLUSIONS: Police deploying overseas 
      appear to have similar rates of dengue and tuberculosis conversion as other groups 
      of travelers, and they appear to be at low risk of hepatitis C and HIV. 
      Strongyloidiasis appears to be a significant risk; postdeployment prevalence was 
      markedly higher than that reported in a small number of studies.

AB  - Public health is still seriously threatened by dengue virus (DENV) and no vaccine 
      against DENV is yet available for clinical use till now. In this study, DNA vaccine 
      candidates encoding DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) prM/E (premembrane and envelope 
      proteins) and NS1 (non-structural 1 protein) with or without a gene adjuvant, 
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), were evaluated in the 
      aspects of immunity and protective efficacy in mice. We constructed three plasmids, 
      pCAG-prM/E (which only expressed DENV2 prM/E), pCAG-prM/E/NS1 (which only expressed 
      DENV2 prM/E/NS1) and pCAG-DG (which co-expressed DENV2 prM/E/NS1 and GM-CSF). The 
      expressions of the recombined plasmids were analyzed by immuno-staining in Vero 
      cells. Antibody responses and neutralization activity of the sera from the mice were 
      assayed by ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization test after immunization with 
      the plasmids. Immunized BALB/c mice were intracerebrally challenged with DENV2 to 
      evaluate protective efficacy of the plasmids. The recombinant plasmids could be 
      efficiently expressed in Vero cells and induced different levels of specific 
      anti-DENV2 immune responses. The immunized mice were partially protected. The 
      highest survival rate was observed in the pCAG-DG group although the anti-DENV2 
      titer and neutralization antibody titer were not the highest among the three groups. 
      Our data suggested that pCAG-DG offered better protection against DENV2 infection.

TI  - Wolbachia induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent activation of the Toll 
      pathway to control dengue virus in the mosquito Aedes aegypti.
PG  - E23-31
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1116932108 [doi]
AB  - Wolbachia are maternally transmitted symbiotic bacteria that can spread within 
      insect populations because of their unique ability to manipulate host reproduction. 
      When introduced to nonnative mosquito hosts, Wolbachia induce resistance to a number 
      of human pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV), Plasmodium, and filarial 
      nematodes, but the molecular mechanism involved is unclear. In this study, we have 
      deciphered how Wolbachia infection affects the Aedes aegypti host in inducing 
      resistance to DENV. The microarray assay indicates that transcripts of genes with 
      functions related to immunity and reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions are 
      up-regulated in Ae. aegypti infected with Wolbachia. Infection with this bacterium 
      leads to induction of oxidative stress and an increased level of reactive oxygen 
      species in its mosquito host. Reactive oxygen species elevation is linked to the 
      activation of the Toll pathway, which is essential in mediating the expression of 
      antioxidants to counterbalance oxidative stress. This immune pathway also is 
      responsible for activation of antimicrobial peptides-defensins and cecropins. We 
      provide evidence that these antimicrobial peptides are involved in inhibition of 
      DENV proliferation in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. Utilization of transgenic Ae. 
      aegypti and the RNAi depletion approach has been instrumental in proving the role of 
      defensins and cecropins in the resistance of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti to DENV. 
      These results indicate that a symbiotic bacterium can manipulate the host defense 
      system to facilitate its own persistent infection, resulting in a compromise of the 
      mosquito's ability to host human pathogens. Our discoveries will aid in the 
      development of control strategies for mosquito-transmitted diseases.

AB  - Dengue virus is a major international public health concern, and there is a lack of 
      available effective vaccines. Virus-specific epitopes could help in developing 
      epitope peptide vaccine. Previously, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4F5 
      against nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) of dengue virus 2 (DV2) was developed in our 
      lab. In this work, the B cell epitope recognized by mAb 4F5 was identified using the 
      phage-displayed peptide library. The results of the binding assay and competitive 
      inhibition assay indicated that the peptides, residues 460-469 (U460-469 RVGRNPKNEN) 
      of DV2 NS3 protein, were the B cell epitopes recognized by mAb 4F5. Furthermore, the 
      epitope peptides and a control peptide were synthesized and then immunized female 
      BALB/c mice. ELISA analysis showed that immunization with synthesized epitope 
      peptide elicited a high level of antibody in mice, and immunofluorescent staining 
      showed that the antisera from fusion epitope-immunized mice also responded to DV2 
      NS3 protein, which further characterized the specific response of the present 
      epitope peptide. Therefore, the present work revealed the specificity of the newly 
      identified epitope (U460-469) of DV2 NS3 protein, which may shed light on dengue 
      virus (DV) vaccine design, DV pathogenesis study, and even DV diagnostic reagent 
      development.

      non-structural protein 1 (NS1), IgM, and IgG, and a dengue/Japanese encephalitis 
      virus (JEV) combination IgM ELISA in a prospective series of 201 patients with 
      suspected dengue in Laos. Paired comparisons of medians from serum and plasma 
      samples were not significantly different for Dengue IgM, and NS1 which had the 
      highest number of discordant pairs (both 2%; P = 0.13 and P = 0.25, respectively). 
      Comparison of qualitative final diagnostic interpretations for serum and plasma 
      samples were not significantly different: only 1.5% (3 of 201 for Dengue/JEV IgM and 
      Dengue IgG) and 2.0% (4 of 201; IgM and NS1) showed discordant pairs. These results 
      demonstrate that plasma containing EDTA is suitable for use in these ELISAs.

AB  - Dengue fever is the most important arboviral disease world-wide, with Aedes aegypti 
      being the major vector. Interactions between the mosquito host and dengue viruses 
      (DENV) are complex and vector competence varies among geographically-distinct Ae. 
      aegypti populations. Additionally, dengue is caused by four antigenically-distinct 
      viral serotypes (DENV1-4), each with multiple genotypes. Each virus genotype 
      interacts differently with vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Analyses of 
      alterations in mosquito transcriptional profiles during DENV infection are expected 
      to provide the basis for identifying networks of genes involved in responses to 
      viruses and contribute to the molecular-genetic understanding of vector competence. 
      In addition, this knowledge is anticipated to support the development of novel 
      disease-control strategies. RNA-seq technology was used to assess genome-wide 
      changes in transcript abundance at 1, 4 and 14 days following DENV2 infection in 
      carcasses, midguts and salivary glands of the Ae. aegypti Chetumal strain. DENV2 
      affected the expression of 397 Ae. aegypti genes, most of which were down-regulated 
      by viral infection. Differential accumulation of transcripts was mainly tissue- and 
      time-specific. Comparisons of our data with other published reports reveal 
      conservation of functional classes, but limited concordance of specific mosquito 
      genes responsive to DENV2 infection. These results indicate the necessity of 
      additional studies of mosquito-DENV interactions, specifically those focused on 
      recently-derived mosquito strains with multiple dengue virus serotypes and 
      genotypes.

AB  - We generated in the mosquito cell line C6/36 a dengue virus (DENV) resistant to 
      Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA), a carbohydrate-binding agent (CBA). The 
      genotype and phenotype were characterized of the HHA resistant (HHA(res)) DENV 
      compared to the wild-type (WT) DENV. Sequencing the structural proteins of HHA(res) 
      resulted in two mutations, N67D and T155I, indicating a deletion of both 
      N-glycosylation sites on the viral envelope E-glycoprotein. The HHA(res) DENV could 
      replicate in mammalian and mosquito cells that are lacking dendritic cell-specific 
      intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) expression. In 
      contrast, DC-SIGN expressing human cells namely monocyte-derived dendritic cells as 
      well as DC-SIGN-transfected cells were no longer susceptible to HHA(res) DENV. This 
      demonstrates a crucial role of the N-glycans in the E-glycoprotein in the infection 
      of dendritic cells, which constitute primary target cells of DENV during viral 
      pathogenesis in the human body.

TI  - Feasibility of ultra-low-volume indoor space spraying for dengue control in Southern 
      Thailand.
PG  - 230-6
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12030 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of conducting standard indoor space spraying 
      using ultra-low-volume (SID-ULV) in terms of willingness to pay (WTP) and ability to 
      pay (ATP) and ability to conduct space spraying by local administrative 
      organisations (LAO) in lower Southern Thailand. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. The 
      executive leaders of each LAO were asked to state their WTP and ATP for SID-ULV. 
      Willingness to pay was measured by the payment card and open-ended question methods. 
      Ability to pay was calculated using the budget allocation for space spraying and 
      estimated expenditure for SID-ULV. Ability to conduct the SID-ULV was assessed by 
      interviewing the spraymen. Average WTP and ATP were calculated and uncertainties 
      were estimated using a bootstrapping technique. RESULTS: Ninty-three percent of 
      executive leaders were willing to pay for SID-ULV. The average WTP per case was USD 
      259 (95% confidence interval [CI] 217-303). Thirty-eight percent of all LAO had 
      actual ATP and 60% had ideal ATP. The average annual budget allocated for space 
      spraying was USD 2327 (95% CI: 1654-3138). The amount of money LAO were willing to 
      pay did not vary significantly between their different types, but ATP did. 
      Thirty-two percent of spraymen could not complete all nine procedures of SID-ULV. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although WTP for SID-ULV space spraying was high, ATP was low, which 
      revealed the flexibility of budget allocation for SID-ULV in each LAO. The spraymen 
      require training in SID-ULV space spraying.

TI  - Case series of naturally acquired Plasmodium knowlesi infection in a tertiary 
      teaching hospital.
PG  - 398-404
AB  - Plasmodium knowlesi is a simian malaria parasite and is recently recognized as the 
      fifth malaria parasite infecting humans. Manifestation of the infection may resemble 
      other infection particularly dengue fever leading to inappropriate management and 
      delay in treatment. We reported three cases of naturally acquired P. knowlesi in 
      Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia. Clinical 
      manifestations were quite similar in those cases. Microscopically, the diagnosis 
      might be challenging. These cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction method 
      which serves as a gold standard.

TI  - Productivity and population density estimates of the dengue vector mosquito Aedes

PG  - 313-22
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2915.2012.01051.x [doi]
AB  - New mosquito control strategies centred on the modifying of populations require 
      knowledge of existing population densities at release sites and an understanding of 
      breeding site ecology. Using a quantitative pupal survey method, we investigated 
      production of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti (L.) (Stegomyia aegypti) (Diptera: 
      Culicidae) in Cairns, Queensland, Australia, and found that garden accoutrements 
      represented the most common container type. Deliberately placed 'sentinel' 
      containers were set at seven houses and sampled for pupae over 10 weeks during the 
      wet season. Pupal production was approximately constant; tyres and buckets 
      represented the most productive container types. Sentinel tyres produced the largest 
      female mosquitoes, but were relatively rare in the field survey. We then used 
      field-collected data to make estimates of per premises population density using 
      three different approaches. Estimates of female Ae. aegypti abundance per premises 
      made using the container-inhabiting mosquito simulation (CIMSiM) model [95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 18.5-29.1 females] concorded reasonably well with estimates 
      obtained using a standing crop calculation based on pupal collections (95% CI 
      8.8-22.5) and using BG-Sentinel traps and a sampling rate correction factor (95% CI 
      6.2-35.2). By first describing local Ae. aegypti productivity, we were able to 
      compare three separate population density estimates which provided similar results. 
      We anticipate that this will provide researchers and health officials with several 
      tools with which to make estimates of population densities.

PG  - 341-8

AB  - Dengue virus infections are a major cause of morbidity in tropical countries. Early 
      detection of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) may help identify individuals that would 
      benefit from intensive therapy. Predictive modeling was performed using 11 
      laboratory values of 51 individuals (38 DF and 13 DHF) obtained on initial 
      presentation using logistic regression. We produced a robust model with an area 
      under the curve of 0.9615 that retained IL-10 levels, platelets, and lymphocytes as 
      the major predictive features. A classification and regression tree was developed on 
      these features that were 86% accurate on cross-validation. The IL-10 levels and 
      platelet counts were also identified as the most informative features associated 
      with DHF using a Random Forest classifier. In the presence of polymerase chain 
      reaction-proven acute dengue infections, we suggest a complete blood count and rapid 
      measurement of IL-10 can assist in the triage of potential DHF cases for close 
      follow-up or clinical intervention improving clinical outcome.

TI  - Flaviviruses and flavivirus vaccines.
PG  - 4301-6
LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.09.114 [doi]
AB  - Several human-pathogenic flaviviruses (including yellow fever, dengue, Japanese 
      encephalitis, West Nile and tick-borne encephalitis viruses) have a significant 
      public health impact in different parts of the world and the potential of emerging 
      in previously non-endemic regions. For some viruses, the structure of the most 
      important immunogen, the envelope protein E, has been determined to atomic 
      resolution by X-ray crystallography, and the architecture of virus particles has 
      been resolved by cryo-electron microscopy. Through the combination of structural and 
      immunological investigations, we now have a detailed understanding of the mechanisms 
      of virus neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infectivity at a 
      molecular level. The latter phenomenon has been proposed to play an important role 
      in the immunopathology of severe forms of dengue virus infections (hemorrhagic 
      dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome) and is therefore of special relevance in the 
      context of dengue vaccines. Effective human vaccines are in use for the prophylaxis 
      of yellow fever (live attenuated), Japanese encephalitis (live attenuated and 
      inactivated whole virus), and tick-borne encephalitis (inactivated whole virus). 
      Although dengue is the most important flavivirus with respect to global disease 
      incidence, the development and use of vaccines has been hampered so far by the 
      theoretical risk of vaccine-related adverse events such as immune enhancement of 
      infection and the requirement to induce a long-lasting protective immune response 
      against all four dengue serotypes simultaneously. Currently, several kinds of dengue 
      vaccines are in development, but only one of these candidates (a chimeric 
      dengue-yellow fever live attenuated vaccine) has reached the stage of phase 3 
      clinical trials.

AB  - The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) cause dengue fever (DF) and dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Severe disease has been 
      associated with heterotypic secondary DENV infection, mediated by cross-reactive 
      antibodies (Abs) and/or cross-reactive T cells. The role of cross-reactive immunity 
      in mediating enhanced disease versus cross-protection against secondary heterotypic 
      DENV infection is not well defined. A better understanding of the cross-reactive 
      immune response in natural infections is critical for development of safe and 
      effective tetravalent vaccines. We studied the B cell phenotype of circulating B 
      cells in the blood of pediatric patients suspected of dengue during the 2010-2011 
      dengue season in Managua, Nicaragua (n  =  216), which was dominated by the DENV-3 
      serotype. We found a markedly larger percentage of plasmablast/plasma cells (PB/PCs) 
      circulating in DENV-positive patients as compared to patients with Other Febrile 
      Illnesses (OFIs). The percentage of DENV-specific PB/PCs against DENV-3 represented 
      10% of the circulating antibody-producing cells (ASCs) in secondary DENV-3 
      infections. Importantly, the cross-reactive DENV-specific B cell response was higher 
      against a heterotypic serotype, with 46% of circulating PB/PCs specific to DENV-2 
      and 10% specific to DENV-3 during acute infection. We also observed a higher 
      cross-reactive DENV-specific IgG serum avidity directed against DENV-2 as compared 
      to DENV-3 during acute infection. The neutralization capacity of the serum was 
      broadly cross-reactive against the four DENV serotypes both during the acute phase 
      and at 3 months post-onset of symptoms. Overall, the cross-reactive B cell immune 
      response dominates during secondary DENV infections in humans. These results reflect 
      our recent findings in a mouse model of DENV cross-protection. In addition, this 
      study enabled the development of increased technical and research capacity of 
      Nicaraguan scientists and the implementation of several new immunological assays in 
      the field.

TI  - High-resolution analysis of intrahost genetic diversity in dengue virus serotype 1 
      infection identifies mixed infections.
PG  - 835-43
LID - 10.1128/JVI.05985-11 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about the rate at which genetic variation is generated within 
      intrahost populations of dengue virus (DENV) and what implications this diversity 
      has for dengue pathogenesis, disease severity, and host immunity. Previous studies 
      of intrahost DENV variation have used a low frequency of sampling and/or 
      experimental methods that do not fully account for errors generated through 
      amplification and sequencing of viral RNAs. We investigated the extent and pattern 
      of genetic diversity in sequence data in domain III (DIII) of the envelope (E) gene 
      in serial plasma samples (n = 49) taken from 17 patients infected with DENV type 1 
      (DENV-1), totaling some 8,458 clones. Statistically rigorous approaches were 
      employed to account for artifactual variants resulting from amplification and 
      sequencing, which we suggest have played a major role in previous studies of 
      intrahost genetic variation. Accordingly, nucleotide sequence diversities of viral 
      populations were very low, with conservative estimates of the average levels of 
      genetic diversity ranging from 0 to 0.0013. Despite such sequence conservation, we 
      observed clear evidence for mixed infection, with the presence of multiple 
      phylogenetically distinct lineages present within the same host, while the presence 
      of stop codon mutations in some samples suggests the action of complementation. In 
      contrast to some previous studies we observed no relationship between the extent and 
      pattern of DENV-1 genetic diversity and disease severity, immune status, or level of 
      viremia.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes fever and severe haemorrhagic symptoms in humans. The 
      DEN2 16681 strain, derived from a dengue haemorrhagic fever patient, has been widely 
      used in studies related to DENV pathogenesis, such as mouse and non-human primate 
      haemorrhagic models and human vascular endothelial-cell permeability. To clarify the 
      entry mechanism of the 16681 strain, we characterized a novel cell receptor for this 
      strain. Our two major findings were as follows: firstly, the SDC2 membrane protein 
      was an effective DEN2 16681 receptor in a cloned K562 cell line. Secondly, a heparan 
      sulfate (HS) glycochain (of four glycochains in SDC2) is the specific binding site 
      of DENV and seems to be involved in tissue-culture adaptation. Our findings present 
      an entry mechanism that could be implicated for DENV adaptation and HS-mediated DENV 
      infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recognizing the uniqueness of secondary dengue virus (DENV)-1/3 dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) cases at an interval of 24 years, 
      we sought to estimate DENV infections as well as the ratios between mild disease and 
      DHF/DSS by DENV infection sequence in Playa District (Havana, Cuba) during the 
      2001-2002 outbreak of dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3). METHODS: A retrospective 
      seroepidemiological study was conducted in 2003 in Playa District. Blood samples 
      were collected from a 1% random sample of residents and were studied for the 
      prevalence of dengue neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: DENV-3 was found to have 
      infected 7.2% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 6.0-8.4%) of susceptible individuals 
      (the entire cohort), the majority of whom experienced silent infections. Virtually 
      every individual who had a secondary infection in the sequence DENV-1 then DENV-3 
      became ill, with a ratio of severe to mild cases of 1:35 (95% CI 1:67-1:23). 
      Secondary infections in the sequence DENV-2/3 were less pathogenic than DENV-1/3. 
      Mild disease accompanying secondary DENV2/3 occurred at a ratio of 1:4.49 infections 
      (95% CI 1:5.77-1:3.42) secondary infections. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained 
      highlight the role of the infecting serotype and also the sequence of the viral 
      infection in the clinical outcome of a dengue infection.

AB  - Aedes aegypti is a blood-feeding mosquito that transmits human pathogens such as 
      Dengue virus, Yellow Fever virus and Chikungunya virus. Recently, dramatic changes 
      in the transcriptome of Ae. aegypti following a blood meal have been reported; 
      however, the molecular factors involved in regulating these changes are largely 
      unknown. In this study, we found induction of a number of endogenous microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) in blood fed (BF) mosquitoes. One of these miRNAs, aae-miR-375, was only 
      detected in BF mosquitoes. Based on target analyses, we found six different genes 
      involved in development and immunity being regulated by aae-miR-375 at the 
      post-transcriptional level. We further confirmed the specific interaction of 
      aae-miR-375 with the target sequences in the transcripts of two immune related 
      genes, cactus and REL1, using a GFP-based reporter assay. Overall, results from this 
      report indicate that miRNAs induced upon blood feeding can regulate the transcript 
      levels of several genes that are important in development and immune responses in 
      mosquitoes. In addition, we demonstrate that aae-miR-375 enhances Dengue virus 
      serotype 2 (DENV-2) infection in an Ae. aegypti cell line.

PG  - 506-9
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.12-0619 [doi]
AB  - Despite the availability of many methods for rapid and early diagnosis of dengue, 
      there is still a need to develop new approaches that not only combine low cost, 
      specificity, and sensitivity, but also are capable of accurately detecting secondary 
      infection in the early stages of the disease. We report the potential of the high 
      mobility group box 1 protein as an auxiliary biomarker for early dengue diagnosis. 
      We tested a 205-sample serum panel that included negative and positive samples from 
      primary and secondary dengue cases, as well as samples from patients with 
      dengue-like symptoms. We observed that high mobility group box 1 protein was 
      generally detected only in dengue-positive samples for persons with primary and 
      secondary infections. These results highlight the possibility of using this 
      endogenous molecule as an auxiliary biomarker to aid in dengue detection and improve 
      current methods for early diagnosis of dengue.

AB  - A tetravalent DNA vaccine formulated with Vaxfectin adjuvant was shown to elicit 
      high levels of neutralizing antibody against all four dengue virus serotypes (Porter 
      et al., ( 16) ), warranting further testing in humans. In preparation for a phase 1 
      clinical testing, the vaccine and the adjuvant were manufactured under current good 
      manufacturing practice guidelines. The formulated vaccine and the adjuvant were 
      tested for safety and/or immunogenicity in New Zealand white rabbits using a repeat 
      dose toxicology study. The formulated vaccine and the adjuvant were found to be well 
      tolerated by the animals. Animals injected with formulated vaccine produced strong 
      neutralizing antibody response to all four dengue serotypes.

TI  - A vaccine formulation consisting of nucleocapsid-like particles from Dengue-2 and 
      the fusion protein P64k-domain III from Dengue-1 induces a protective immune 
      response against the homologous serotypes in mice.
PG  - 107-12

AB  - In previous studies we reported the cloning, expression and purification of the 
      capsid protein from Dengue-2 virus. Subsequently, we described an in vitro-assembly 
      process for the capsid protein, which resulted in nucleocapsid-like particles 
      (recNLPs) that induced functional cell-mediated immunity and protection in mice. 
      Moreover, our group reported the evaluation in non-human primates of the fusion 
      protein P64k-domain III from Dengue-1 (PD10). This protein proved to be immunogenic 
      and protective when Freund's adjuvant, but not alum, was used. Based on the 
      previously demonstrated capacity of recNLPs to potentiate the immunogenicity of 
      heterologous proteins, in this study we assess the immune response elicited by the 
      formulation PD10-recNLPs-alum and its protective capacity against Dengue-1 and 
      Dengue-2 virus. As expected, the humoral immune response was mainly directed against 
      Dengue-1, while high levels of IFN-γ secretion were detected after stimulation with 
      Dengue-1 and Dengue-2. Consistently, animals immunized with the bivalent formulation 
      were significantly protected against challenge with either Dengue serotype. In 
      conclusion, this report describes a novel formulation based on recombinant proteins 
      and alum, which is protective against Dengue-1 and Dengue-2 in mice.

AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main domestic vector of the dengue virus. Control measures to 
      prevent dengue transmission focus on the treatment and elimination of this vector's 
      oviposition sites. There is limited biological information on Ae. aegypti in 
      Argentina. The aim of this study was to characterize Ae. aegypti oviposition sites 
      in the city of Puerto Iguazú, Argentina. We surveyed an area covering nine 
      neighborhoods in 2005. We identified 191 premises as positive for Ae. aegypti, 
      giving a general house index of 9.6%. Premises classified as residential and vacant 
      lots presented the highest number of infested premises, with 9% and 22% 
      respectively. The total number of surveyed containers was 29,600. The overall 
      container index (CI) was 1.1. The most frequently infested containers were water 
      tanks (CI = 37). These preliminary results suggest that vacant lots and water tanks 
      provide suitable breeding areas and environmental conditions, improving the chances 
      of Ae. aegypti survival in Puerto Iguazú.

TI  - Uncoupling cis-Acting RNA elements from coding sequences revealed a requirement of

PG  - 1046-58
LID - 10.1128/JVI.05431-11 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about the mechanism of flavivirus genome encapsidation. Here, 
      functional elements of the dengue virus (DENV) capsid (C) protein were investigated. 
      Study of the N-terminal region of DENV C has been limited by the presence of 
      overlapping cis-acting RNA elements within the protein-coding region. To dissociate 
      these two functions, we used a recombinant DENV RNA with a duplication of essential 
      RNA structures outside the C coding sequence. By the use of this system, the highly 
      conserved amino acids FNML, which are encoded in the RNA cyclization sequence 5'CS, 
      were found to be dispensable for C function. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal 
      18 amino acids of C impaired DENV particle formation. Two clusters of basic residues 
      (R5-K6-K7-R9 and K17-R18-R20-R22) were identified as important. A systematic 
      mutational analysis indicated that a high density of positive charges, rather than 
      particular residues at specific positions, was necessary. Furthermore, a 
      differential requirement of N-terminal sequences of C for viral particle assembly 
      was observed in mosquito and human cells. While no viral particles were observed in 
      human cells with a virus lacking the first 18 residues of C, DENV propagation was 
      detected in mosquito cells, although to a level about 50-fold less than that 
      observed for a wild-type (WT) virus. We conclude that basic residues at the N 
      terminus of C are necessary for efficient particle formation in mosquito cells but 
      that they are crucial for propagation in human cells. This is the first report 
      demonstrating that the N terminus of C plays a role in DENV particle formation. In 
      addition, our results suggest that this function of C is differentially modulated in 
      different host cells.

AB  - The spread of Aedes albopictus by Eastern Spain has been constant since its first 
      finding in 2004. Currently the species has been collected in the coastal provinces 
      of Girona, Barcelona, Tarragona, Castellón, Alicante and Murcia. The high 
      synanthropism of the species, together with its anthropophilic behaviour and 
      vectorial capacity to transmit several arboviruses, have led to the return of active 
      transmission cycles of common diseases in the past such as Dengue virus and even the 
      appearance of new tropical viruses as Chikungunya in southern Europe. This 
      manuscript discusses the public health implications of the expected expansion of Ae. 
      albopictus for much of the Iberian Peninsula, in the context of current climatic and 
      sociodemographic situation. Moreover, several issues related with the control of the 
      species in urban and suburban environments are exposed. Finally the preliminary data 
      about other invasive aedines recently collected in the European continent are 
      presented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a global public health problem for which no drug or vaccine is 
      available. Currently, there is increasing interest in developing non-replicating 
      dengue vaccines based on a discrete antigenic domain of the major structural protein 
      of dengue viruses (DENVs), known as envelope domain III (EDIII). The use of 
      bio-nanoparticles consisting of recombinant viral structural polypeptides, better 
      known as virus-like particles (VLPs), has emerged as a potential platform technology 
      for vaccine development. This work explores the feasibility of developing 
      nanoparticles based on E. coli-expressed recombinant Hepatitis B virus core antigen 
      (HBcAg) designed to display EDIII moiety of DENV on the surface. FINDINGS: We 
      designed a synthetic gene construct encoding HBcAg containing an EDIII insert in its 
      c/e1 loop. The fusion antigen HBcAg-EDIII-2 was expressed in E. coli, purified to 
      near homogeneity using Ni+2 affinity chromatography and demonstrated to assemble 
      into discrete 35-40 nm VLPs by electron microscopy. Competitive ELISA analyses 
      showed that the EDIII-2 moieties of the VLPs are accessible to anti-EDIII-2-specific 
      monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, suggesting that they are surface-displayed. 
      The VLPs were highly immunogenic eliciting high titer anti-EDIII-2 antibodies that 
      were able to recognize, bind and neutralize infectious DENV based on ELISA, 
      immunofluorescence and virus-neutralization assays. CONCLUSION: This work 
      demonstrates that HBcAg-derived nanoparticles can serve as a useful platform for the 
      display of DENV EDIII. The EDIII-displaying nanoparticles may have potential 
      applications in diagnostics/vaccines for dengue.

AB  - We examined changes in the abundance of immature Aedes aegypti at the household and 
      water storage container level during the dry-season (June-July, 2008) in Tri Nguyen 
      village, central Vietnam. We conducted quantitative immature mosquito surveys of 171 
      containers in the same 41 households, with replacement of samples, every two days 
      during a 29-day period. We developed multi-level mixed effects regression models to 
      investigate container and household variability in pupal abundance. The percentage 
      of houses that were positive for I/II instars, III/IV instars and pupae during any 
      one survey ranged from 19.5-43.9%, 48.8-75.6% and 17.1-53.7%, respectively. The mean 
      numbers of Ae. aegypti pupae per house ranged between 1.9-12.6 over the study 
      period. Estimates of absolute pupal abundance were highly variable over the 29-day 
      period despite relatively stable weather conditions. Most variability in pupal 
      abundance occurred at the container rather than the household level. A key 
      determinant of Ae. aegypti production was the frequent filling of the containers 
      with water, which caused asynchronous hatching of Ae. aegypti eggs and development 
      of cohorts of immatures. We calculated the probability of the water volume of a 
      large container (>500 L) increasing or decreasing by ≥20% to be 0.05 and 0.07 per 
      day, respectively, and for small containers (<500 L) to be 0.11 and 0.13 per day, 
      respectively. These human water-management behaviors are important determinants of 
      Ae. aegypti production during the dry season. This has implications for choosing a 
      suitable Wolbachia strain for release as it appears that prolonged egg desiccation 
      does not occur in this village.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a global disease threat for which there are no approved 
      antivirals or vaccines. Establishing state-of-the-art screening systems that rely on 
      fluorescent or luminescent reporters may accelerate the development of anti-DENV 
      therapeutics. However, relatively few reporter DENV platforms exist. Here, we show 
      that DENV can be genetically engineered to express a green fluorescent protein or 
      firefly luciferase. Reporter viruses are infectious in vitro and in vivo and are 
      sensitive to antiviral compounds, neutralizing antibodies, and interferons. 
      Bioluminescence imaging was used to follow the dynamics of DENV infection in mice 
      and revealed that the virus localized predominantly to lymphoid and gut-associated 
      tissues. The high-throughput potential of reporter DENV was demonstrated by 
      screening a library of more than 350 IFN-stimulated genes for antiviral activity. 
      Several antiviral effectors were identified, and they targeted DENV at two distinct 
      life cycle steps. These viruses provide a powerful platform for applications ranging 
      from validation of vaccine candidates to antiviral discovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever regardless of its serotypes has been the most prevalent 
      arthropod-borne viral diseases among the world population. The development of a 
      dengue vaccine is complicated by the antibody-dependent enhancement effect. Thus, 
      the development of a plant-based antiviral preparation promises a more potential 
      alternative in combating dengue disease. METHODS: Present studies investigated the 
      antiviral effects of standardised methanolic extracts of Andrographis paniculata, 
      Citrus limon, Cymbopogon citratus, Momordica charantia, Ocimum sanctum and 
      Pelargonium citrosum on dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1). RESULTS: O. sanctum 
      contained 88.6% of total flavonoids content, an amount that was the highest among 
      all the six plants tested while the least was detected in M. charantia. In this 
      study, the maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD) of the six medicinal plants was determined 
      by testing the methanolic extracts against Vero E6 cells in vitro. Studies also 
      determined that the MNTD of methanolic extract was in the decreasing order of M. 
      charantia >C. limon >P. citrosum, O. sanctum >A. paniculata >C. citratus. Antiviral 
      assay based on cytopathic effects (CPE) denoted by degree of inhibition upon 
      treating DENV1-infected Vero E6 cells with MNTD of six medicinal plants showed that 
      A. paniculata has the most antiviral inhibitory effects followed by M. charantia. 
      These results were further verified with an in vitro inhibition assay using MTT, in 
      which 113.0% and 98.0% of cell viability were recorded as opposed to 44.6% in DENV-1 
      infected cells. Although methanolic extracts of O. sanctum and C. citratus showed 
      slight inhibition effect based on CPE, a significant inhibition was not reflected in 
      MTT assay. Methanolic extracts of C. limon and P. citrosum did not prevent 
      cytopathic effects or cell death from DENV-1. CONCLUSIONS: The methanol extracts of 
      A. paniculata and M. charantia possess the ability of inhibiting the activity of 
      DENV-1 in in vitro assays. Both of these plants are worth to be further investigated 
      and might be advantageous as an alternative for dengue treatment.

AB  - To investigate trends in travel-associated morbidity with particular emphasis on 
      emerging infections with the potential for introduction into Europe, diagnoses of 
      7,408 returning travellers presenting to 16 EuroTravNet sites in 2010 were compared 
      with 2008 and 2009. A significant increase in reported Plasmodium falciparum malaria 
      (n=361 (6% of all travel-related morbidity) vs. n=254 (4%) and 260 (5%); p<0.001), 
      P. vivax malaria (n=51 (1%) vs. n=31 (0.5%) and 38 (1%); p=0.027) and dengue fever 
      (n=299 (5%) vs. n=127 (2%) and 127 (2%); p<0.001) was observed. Giardia lamblia was 
      identified in 16% of patients with acute diarrhoea, with no significant annual 
      variation. The proportion of acute diarrhoea due to Campylobacter increased from 7% 
      in 2008 to 12% in 2010 (p=0.001). We recorded 121 patients with pulmonary 
      tuberculosis in 2010, a threefold increase in the proportionate morbidity from 2008 
      to 2010. In 2010, 60 (0.8%) cases of chronic Chagas disease, 151 (2%) cases of 
      schistosomiasis and 112 (2%) cases of cutaneous larva migrans were reported. Illness 
      patterns in sentinel travellers, captured by EuroTravnet, continue to highlight the 
      potential role of travellers in the emergence of infectious diseases of public 
      health concern in Europe and the relevance of offering medical travel advice and 
      enforcing specific and adequate prophylaxis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a rapid, cost effective RT-PCR method for the mass scale 
      diagnosis of such diseases at the viremia stage to find out the actual disease 
      burden in that area. METHODS: For this purpose, cases with the history of only short 
      febrile illness were considered. Thus 157 samples with the history of 
      dengue/chikungunya like illness and only 58 samples with a history of acute 
      encephalitis syndrome (AES) were selected. RESULTS: Out of 157 samples, 42 and 74 
      were detected as dengue and chikungunya, respectively and out of 58 AES cases only 
      23 could be detected as Japanese encephalitis by this RT-PCR method. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This cost effective RT-PCR method can detect the total positive cases that remain 
      undetected by ELISA method. Moreover, this method is capable to detect the viral RNA

AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence density and prevalence of 
      dengue virus infection in Australian travellers to Asia. We conducted a multi-centre 
      prospective cohort study of Australian travellers over a 32-month period. We 
      recruited 467 travellers (≥ 16 years of age) from three travel clinics who intended 
      to travel Asia, and 387 (82.9%) of those travellers completed questionnaires and 
      provide samples pre- and post-travel for serological testing for dengue virus 
      infection. Demographic data, destination countries and history of vaccinations and 
      flavivirus infections were obtained. Serological testing for dengue IgG and IgM by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (PanBio assay) was performed. Acute 
      seroconversion for dengue infection was demonstrated in 1.0% of travellers, 
      representing an incidence of 3.4 infections per 10,000 days of travel (95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 0.9-8.7). The seroprevalence of dengue infection was 4.4% 
      and a greater number of prior trips to Asia was a predictor for dengue 
      seroprevalence (p = 0.019). All travellers experienced subclinical dengue infections 
      and had travelled to India (n = 3) and China (n = 1). This significant attack rate 
      of dengue infection can be used to advise prospective travellers to dengue-endemic 
      countries.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-12-272 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Managing a severe dengue infection is a challenge specially when 
      complicated by other comorbidities. We report a patient with dengue haemorrhagic 
      fever and spontaneous bleeding who required mandatory anticoagulation for a 
      prosthetic mitral valve replacement. This is the first case report in published 
      literature describing this therapeutic dilemma. CASE PRESENTATION: A fifty one year 
      old Sri Lankan woman was diagnosed with dengue haemorrhagic fever with bleeding 
      manifestations. During the critical phase of her illness, the platelet count dropped 
      to 5,000/ɥl. She was also on warfarin 7 mg daily following a prosthetic mitral valve 
      insertion. In managing the patient, the risk of bleeding had to be balanced against 
      the risk of valve thrombosis without anticoagulation. Warfarin was withheld when the 
      platelet count dropped to 100,000/ɥl and restarted when it recovered above 
      50,000/ɥl. The patient was off anticoagulation for 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: We managed 
      this patient with close observation and continuous risk benefit assessments of 
      management decisions. However, experience with one patient cannot be generalized to 
      others. Therefore, it is essential that clinicians share their experiences in 
      managing such difficult patients.

PG  - 12-22
AB  - Search for drugs efficient in prophylaxis and treatment of dangerous infections 
      (especially arboviral ones) is rather actual, since no specific therapy is 
      available. Many-year investigations of interferon inductors showed that they had 
      immunomodulating, antiviral and antiinflammatory effects and were low toxic. The 
      present study demonstrated that the protective effect was the following: Venezuelan 
      equine encephalitis (VEE)--cycloferon > amixin = ridostin, Rift Valley fever 
      (RVF)--cycloferon > amixin > ridostin, predator pox (PP)--cycloferon > amixin = 
      ridostin, that was obvious that cycloferon was the most active agent in the 
      treatment of VEE, RVF and PP, thus making it possible to acknowledge its priority in 
      prophylaxis and therapy of dangerous viral infections (DVI). Ribavirin in 
      combination with cycloferon solution or cycloferon tablets provided shorter periods 
      of the fever, minimized the intoxication syndrome, promoted earlier resolution of 
      hemorrhagic eruption and lowered the frequency of complications, which was in favour 
      of the disease prognosis.

AB  - The incidence of extreme precipitation has increased with the exacerbation of 
      worldwide climate disruption. We hypothesize an association between precipitation 
      and the distribution patterns that would affect the endemic burden of 8 infectious 
      diseases in Taiwan, including water- and vector-borne infectious diseases. A 
      database integrating daily precipitation and temperature, along with the infectious 
      disease case registry for all 352 townships in the main island of Taiwan was 
      analysed for the period from 1994 to 2008. Four precipitation levels, <130 mm, 
      130-200 mm, 200-350 mm and >350 mm, were categorized to represent quantitative 
      differences, and their associations with each specific disease was investigated 
      using the Generalized Additive Mixed Model and afterwards mapped on to the 
      Geographical Information System. Daily precipitation levels were significantly 
      correlated with all 8 mandatory-notified infectious diseases in Taiwan. For 
      water-borne infections, extreme torrential precipitation (>350 mm/day) was found to 
      result in the highest relative risk for bacillary dysentery and enterovirus 
      infections when compared to ordinary rain (<130 mm/day). Yet, for vector-borne 
      diseases, the relative risk of dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis increased with 
      greater precipitation only up to 350 mm. Differential lag effects following 
      precipitation were statistically associated with increased risk for contracting 
      individual infectious diseases. This study's findings can help health resource 
      sector management better allocate medical resources and be better prepared to deal 
      with infectious disease outbreaks following future extreme precipitation events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) co-circulate in areas 
      endemic with the Aedes mosquito vectors. Both viruses cause similar illnesses which 
      may be difficult to distinguish clinically. CHIKV is also associated with persistent 
      arthralgia. OBJECTIVES: To compare and describe factors which differentiate between 
      DENV and CHIKV infections on presentation; and to describe predictors of persistent 
      arthralgia in CHIKV patients. STUDY DESIGN: Patients aged >14 years diagnosed with 
      acute CHIKV and DENV infections in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia were retrospectively 
      identified. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from medical records, and 
      compared. CHIKV patients were telephoned 15-24 months later and interviewed about 
      persistent symptoms. Logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 
      53 CHIKV and 113 DENV patients were included. CHIKV patients were older and more 
      likely to be female. CHIKV was independently associated with arthralgia and rash, 
      while DENV was associated with myalgia, raised aspartate transaminase, and 
      leucopaenia. Forty CHIKV patients were followed up, with a median duration of 
      self-reported arthralgia of 3 months (range, 0-24 months). Eighteen (45%) had 
      persistent arthralgia beyond 4 months, for which age >40 years was an independent 
      predictor. At 1 year, 9 (22.5%) patients had arthralgia. CONCLUSION: In Kuala 
      Lumpur, selected clinical and laboratory predictors help to distinguish between DENV 
      and CHIKV infections. Persistent arthralgia was a frequent sequel of CHIKV infection 
      in this cohort.

      management and treatment options.

AB  - In the poorest regions of the United States, especially along the Gulf Coast and in 
      South Texas, are a group of endemic parasitic and related infections known as the 
      neglected infections of poverty. Such infections are characterized by their 
      chronicity, disabling features, and disproportionate impact on the estimated 46 
      million people who live below the U.S. poverty line. Today more Americans live in 
      poverty than ever before in the half-century that the Census Bureau has been 
      recording poverty rates. In association with that poverty, a group of major 
      neglected infections of poverty have emerged in the United States. Here we describe 
      the major neglected infections of poverty in the United States, with a brief 
      overview of their significant epidemiological features, their links with poverty, 
      and our approaches to their diagnosis, management, and treatment.

AB  - Here we investigated the effect of Beauveria bassiana infection on the survival of 
      Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and the modulation of their susceptibility to dengue virus 
      infection. Application of B. bassiana caused a reduction in the life span of 
      A. aegypti and hindered dengue virus replication in the mosquito midgut. Fungus 
      infection induced the expression a variety anti-microbial and dengue virus 
      restriction factor genes. Transient reverse genetic analyses showed that the 
      JAK-STAT pathway is implicated anti-fungal defense of Aedes mosquitoes. Our data 
      suggest that this B. bassiana-mediated anti-dengue activity is likely to be at least 
      partly indirectly mediated through the activation of the mosquito's anti-dengue Toll 
      and JAK-STAT pathways.

TI  - Association of dengue hemorrhagic fever with multiple risk factors for pituitary 
      apoplexy.
PG  - e97-e101
LID - 10.4158/EP11341.CR [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe pituitary apoplexy that developed during the course of dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever. METHODS: We describe the clinical findings, laboratory test 
      results, imaging findings, and clinical course of the study patients. RESULTS: 
      Patient 1 was a 40-year-old man who developed clinical signs and symptoms of dengue, 
      which was confirmed by serologic testing. He presented with thrombocytopenia and 
      developed severe headache and vomiting. During hospitalization, acromegaly was 
      suspected because of the characteristic disease phenotype. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging confirmed the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy. Subsequently, the biochemical 
      diagnosis of acromegaly was confirmed, and the patient underwent transsphenoidal 
      surgery. Histopathologic examination showed signs of recent bleeding. Patient 2 was 
      a 38-year-old man with a macroprolactinoma, who had been treated with cabergoline 
      for 10 weeks and had shown improvement on laboratory testing and imaging. The 
      patient then presented with clinical symptoms of dengue (confirmed serologically) 
      and thrombocytopenia. He developed bilateral hemianopsia, and magnetic resonance 
      imaging showed enlargement of the pituitary adenoma with signs of intratumoral 
      bleeding. The patient underwent transsphenoidal surgery, and histopathologic 
      examination documented a pituitary adenoma diffusely infiltrated by blood cells. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We describe dengue as a probable novel condition for pituitary apoplexy 
      because it may be associated with multiple risk factors for pituitary infarction or 
      bleeding. Physicians should suspect pituitary apoplexy in patients with dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever who develop a rapid onset of severe headache and vision defects, 
      even in those without known pituitary adenomas.

      multivalent antigens and targeted antivirals.
PG  - S9
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-13-S13-S9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Analysis of large sets of biological sequence data from related strains 
      or organisms is complicated by superficial redundancy in the set, which may contain 
      many members that are identical except at one or two positions. Thus a new method, 
      based on deriving physicochemical property (PCP)-consensus sequences, was tested for 
      its ability to generate reference sequences and distinguish functionally significant 
      changes from background variability. METHODS: The PCP consensus program was used to 
      automatically derive consensus sequences starting from sequence alignments of 
      proteins from Flaviviruses (from the Flavitrack database) and human enteroviruses, 
      using a five dimensional set of Eigenvectors that summarize over 200 different 
      scalar values for the PCPs of the amino acids. A PCP-consensus protein of a Dengue 
      virus envelope protein was produced recombinantly and tested for its ability to bind 
      antibodies to strains using ELISA. RESULTS: PCP-consensus sequences of the 
      flavivirus family could be used to classify them into five discrete groups and 
      distinguish areas of the envelope proteins that correlate with host specificity and 
      disease type. A multivalent Dengue virus antigen was designed and shown to bind 
      antibodies against all four DENV types. A consensus enteroviral VPg protein had the 
      same distinctive high pKa as wild type proteins and was recognized by two different 
      polymerases. CONCLUSIONS: The process for deriving PCP-consensus sequences for any 
      group of aligned similar sequences, has been validated for sequences with up to 50% 
      diversity. Ongoing projects have shown that the method identifies residues that 
      significantly alter PCPs at a given position, and might thus cause changes in 
      function or immunogenicity. Other potential applications include deriving target 
      proteins for drug design and diagnostic kits.

AB  - 1,2-Benzisothiazol-3(2H)-ones and 1,3,4-oxadiazoles individually have recently 
      attracted considerable interest in drug discovery, including as antibacterial and 
      antifungal agents. In this study, a series of functionalized 
      1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one-1,3,4-oxadiazole hybrid derivatives were synthesized 
      and subsequently screened against Dengue and West Nile virus proteases. Ten out of 
      twenty-four compounds showed greater than 50% inhibition against DENV2 and WNV 
      proteases ([I] = 10 μM). The IC(50) values of compound 7n against DENV2 and WNV 
      NS2B/NS3 were found to be 3.75 ± 0.06 and 4.22 ± 0.07 μM, respectively. The kinetics 
      data support a competitive mode of inhibition by compound 7n. Molecular modeling 
      studies were performed to delineate the putative binding mode of this series of 
      compounds. This study reveals that the hybrid series arising from the linking of the 
      two scaffolds provides a suitable platform for conducting a hit-to-lead optimization 
      campaign via iterative structure-activity relationship studies, in vitro screening 
      and X-ray crystallography.

AB  - Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue virus, is well established throughout 
      urban areas of the Southwestern US, including Tucson, AZ. Local transmission of the 
      dengue virus, however, has not been reported in this area. Although many factors 
      influence the distribution of the dengue virus, we hypothesize that one contributing 
      factor is that the lifespan of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in the Southwestern US 
      is too short for the virus to complete development and be transmitted to a new host. 
      To test this we utilized two age grading techniques. First, we determined parity by 
      analyzing ovarian tracheation and found that only 40% of Ae. aegypti females 
      collected in Tucson, AZ were parous. The second technique determined transcript 
      levels of an age-associated gene, Sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein 1 (SCP-1). 
      SCP-1 expression decreased in a predictable manner as the age of mosquitoes 
      increased regardless of rearing conditions and reproductive status. We developed 
      statistical models based on parity and SCP-1 expression to determine the age of 
      individual, field collected mosquitoes within three age brackets: nonvectors (0-5 
      days post-emergence), unlikely vectors (6-14 days post-emergence), and potential 
      vectors (15+ days post-emergence). The statistical models allowed us to accurately 
      group individual wild mosquitoes into the three age brackets with high confidence. 
      SCP-1 expression levels of individual, field collected mosquitoes were analyzed in 
      conjunction with parity status. Based on SCP-1 transcript levels and parity data, 9% 
      of collected mosquitoes survived more than 15 days post emergence.

LID - e1637
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito borne infection worldwide. 
      Vertical transmissions after maternal dengue infection to the fetus and pregnancy 
      losses in relation to dengue illness have been reported. The relationship of dengue 
      to miscarriage is not known. METHOD: We aimed to establish the relationship of 
      recent dengue infection and miscarriage. Women who presented with miscarriage (up to 
      22 weeks gestation) to our hospital were approached to participate in the study. For 
      each case of miscarriage, we recruited 3 controls with viable pregnancies at a 
      similar gestation. A brief questionnaire on recent febrile illness and prior dengue 
      infection was answered. Blood was drawn from participants, processed and the frozen 
      serum was stored. Stored sera were thawed and then tested in batches with dengue 
      specific IgM capture ELISA, dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen and dengue 
      specific IgG ELISA tests. Controls remained in the analysis if their pregnancies 
      continued beyond 22 weeks gestation. Tests were run on 116 case and 341 control 
      sera. One case (a misdiagnosed viable early pregnancy) plus 45 controls (39 lost to 
      follow up and six subsequent late miscarriages) were excluded from analysis. 
      FINDINGS: Dengue specific IgM or dengue NS1 antigen (indicating recent dengue 
      infection) was positive in 6/115 (5·2%) cases and 5/296 (1·7%) controls RR 3·1 (95% 
      CI 1·0-10) P = 0·047. Maternal age, gestational age, parity and ethnicity were 
      dissimilar between cases and controls. After adjustments for these factors, recent 
      dengue infection remained significantly more frequently detected in cases than 
      controls (AOR 4·2 95% CI 1·2-14 P = 0·023). INTERPRETATION: Recent dengue infections 
      were more frequently detected in women presenting with miscarriage than in controls 
      whose pregnancies were viable. After adjustments for confounders, the positive 
      association remained.

AB  - Two stable infections of Wolbachia pipientis, wMelPop and wMel, now established in 
      Aedes aegypti, are being used in a biocontrol program to suppress the transmission 
      of dengue. Any effects of Wolbachia infection on insecticide resistance of 
      mosquitoes may undermine the success of this program. Bioassays of Ae. aegypti were 
      conducted to test for differences in response to insecticides between Wolbachia 
      infected (wMelPop, wMel) and uninfected lines. Insecticides screened were 
      bifenthrin, the pyrethroid commonly used for adult knockdown, as well as larvicides: 
      Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis, the organophosphate, temephos and the 
      insect growth regulator, s-methoprene. While differences in response between lines 
      were detected for some insecticides, no obvious or consistent effects related to 
      presence of Wolbachia infection were observed. Spreading Wolbachia infections are, 
      therefore, unlikely to affect the efficacy of traditional chemical control of 
      mosquito outbreaks.

TI  - Identification of human neutralizing antibodies that bind to complex epitopes on 
      dengue virions.
PG  - 7439-44
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1200566109 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is spreading at an unprecedented rate and 
      has developed into a major health and economic burden in over 50 countries. Even 
      though infected individuals develop potent and long-lasting serotype-specific 
      neutralizing antibodies (Abs), the epitopes engaged by human neutralizing Abs have 
      not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that the dengue virus (DENV)-specific 
      serum Ab response in humans consists of a large fraction of cross-reactive, poorly 
      neutralizing Abs and a small fraction of serotype-specific, potently inhibitory Abs. 
      Although many mouse-generated, strongly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
      recognize epitopes that are present on recombinant DENV envelope (E) proteins, 
      unexpectedly, the majority of neutralizing Abs in human immune sera bound to intact 
      virions but not to the ectodomain of purified soluble E proteins. These conclusions 
      with polyclonal Abs were confirmed with newly generated human mAbs derived from 
      DENV-immune individuals. Two of three strongly neutralizing human mAbs bound to E 
      protein epitopes that were preserved on the virion but not on recombinant E (rE) 
      protein. We propose that humans produce Abs that neutralize DENV infection by 
      binding a complex, quaternary structure epitope that is expressed only when E 
      proteins are assembled on a virus particle. Mapping studies indicate that this 
      epitope has a footprint that spans adjacent E protein dimers and includes residues 
      at the hinge between domains I and II of E protein. These results have significant 
      implications for the DENV Ab and vaccine field.

PG  - e1505

LID - e1505
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent in-vitro studies have suggested that mast cells are involved in 
      Dengue virus infection. To clarify the role of mast cells in the development of 
      clinical Dengue fever, we compared the plasma levels of several mast cell-derived 
      mediators (vascular endothelial cell growth factor [VEGF], soluble VEGF receptors 
      [sVEGFRs], tryptase, and chymase) and -related cytokines (IL-4, -9, and -17) between 
      patients with differing severity of Dengue fever and healthy controls. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The study was performed at Children's Hospital No. 
      2, Ho Chi Minh City, and Vinh Long Province Hospital, Vietnam from 2002 to 2005. 
      Study patients included 103 with Dengue fever (DF), Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), 
      and Dengue shock syndrome (DSS), as diagnosed by the World Health Organization 
      criteria. There were 189 healthy subjects, and 19 febrile illness patients of the 
      same Kinh ethnicity. The levels of mast cell-derived mediators and -related 
      cytokines in plasma were measured by ELISA. VEGF and sVEGFR-1 levels were 
      significantly increased in DHF and DSS compared with those of DF and controls, 
      whereas sVEGFR-2 levels were significantly decreased in DHF and DSS. Significant 
      increases in tryptase and chymase levels, which were accompanied by high IL-9 and 
      -17 concentrations, were detected in DHF and DSS patients. By day 4 of admission, 
      VEGF, sVEGFRs, and proteases levels had returned to similar levels as DF and 
      controls. In-vitro VEGF production by mast cells was examined in KU812 and HMC-1 
      cells, and was found to be highest when the cells were inoculated with Dengue virus 
      and human Dengue virus-immune serum in the presence of IL-9. CONCLUSIONS: As mast 
      cells are an important source of VEGF, tryptase, and chymase, our findings suggest 
      that mast cell activation and mast cell-derived mediators participate in the 
      development of DHF. The two proteases, particularly chymase, might serve as good 
      predictive markers of Dengue disease severity.

PG  - 48-56
LID - S0074-02762012000100007 [pii]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) and parvovirus B19 (B19V) infections are acute exanthematic 
      febrile illnesses that are not easily differentiated on clinical grounds and affect 
      the paediatric population. Patients with these acute exanthematic diseases were 
      studied. Fever was more frequent in DENV than in B19V-infected patients. 
      Arthritis/arthralgias with DENV infection were shown to be significantly more 
      frequent in adults than in children. The circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-1 
      receptor antagonist (Ra), CXCL10/inducible protein-10 (IP-10), CCL4/macrophage 
      inflammatory protein-1 beta and CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were 
      determined by multiplex immunoassay in serum samples obtained from B19V (37) and 
      DENV-infected (36) patients and from healthy individuals (7). Forward stepwise 
      logistic regression analysis revealed that circulating CXCL10/IP-10 tends to be 
      associated with DENV infection and that IL-1Ra was significantly associated with 
      DENV infection. Similar analysis showed that circulating CCL2/MCP-1 tends to be 
      associated with B19V infection. In dengue fever, increased circulating IL-1Ra may 
      exert antipyretic actions in an effort to counteract the already increased 
      concentrations of IL-1β, while CXCL10/IP-10 was confirmed as a strong 
      pro-inflammatory marker. Recruitment of monocytes/macrophages and upregulation of 
      the humoral immune response by CCL2/MCP-1 by B19V may be involved in the persistence 
      of the infection. Children with B19V or DENV infections had levels of these 
      cytokines similar to those of adult patients.

TI  - Spontaneous splenic rupture in dengue fever with non-fatal outcome in an adult.
PG  - 369-72
AB  - A 26-year-old male presented with fever for five days and abdominal pain for 24 
      hours. System examination identified a soft abdomen with diffuse tenderness. 
      CT-abdomen findings were consistent with splenic rupture with intra and peri-splenic 
      hematoma. Laboratory investigations showed a platelet count of 40,000 per mm(3). In 
      due course he developed hypotension and underwent splenectomy. Non-structural 
      protein 1 (NS1) dengue antigen was positive in the admission sample and IgM dengue 
      antibodies were detected in the follow-up sample. Histopathology of the spleen 
      showed normal architecture with no evidence of hyperplasia, cellular infiltrates or 
      haematological malignancy. Splenic rupture is a rare, but potentially fatal 
      complication of dengue fever and severe dengue which should be suspected when a 
      patient presents with abdominal pain and hypotension. Our case highlights the 
      occurrence of splenic rupture in the viremic phase of dengue illness before the 
      development of IgM antibodies.

TI  - Identification of serotype-specific T cell responses to highly conserved regions of 
      the dengue viruses.
PG  - 215-23

AB  - Determining previous infecting dengue virus (DENV) serotypes has been difficult due 
      to highly cross-reactive immune responses from previous DENV infections. Determining 
      the correlates of serotype-specific immune responses would be crucial in 
      understanding dengue transmission in the community and would also help to determine 
      the correlates of protective immune responses. Therefore, we set out to define 
      highly conserved, serotype-specific regions of the DENVs. Serotype-specific and 
      highly conserved regions of the four DENV serotypes were identified using Basic 
      Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches and custom perl scripts. Using ex-vivo 
      and cultured enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays, we identified 
      serotype-specific T cell epitopes within the four DENV serotypes in healthy adult 
      donors from Sri Lanka. We identified T cell responses to 19 regions of the four DENV 
      serotypes. Six peptides were from the NS2A region and four peptides were from the 
      NS4A region. All immune donors responded to peptides of at least two DENV serotypes, 
      suggesting that heterologous infection is common in Sri Lanka. Eight of 20 
      individuals responded to at least two peptides of DENV-4, despite this serotype not 
      being implicated previously in any of the epidemics in Sri Lanka. The use of these 
      regions to determine past and current infecting DENV serotypes will be of value to 
      characterize further the dynamics of silent dengue transmission in the community. In 
      addition, these T cell responses to these regions could be used to characterize DENV 
      serotype-specific immune responses and thus possibly help us to understand the 
      immune correlates of a protective immune response.

AB  - Dengue fever (DF) is often asymptomatic in endemic areas. Asymptomatic infection 
      during a DF outbreak in China, where DF is not endemic, has not been reported until 
      now. In this study a total of 365 subjects from 6 villages were recruited from 
      October 4-7, 2009. Overall, 102 subjects (27.95%) were positive for dengue virus 
      (DENV) IgM, and 14 subjects (3.84%) were positive for DENV IgG and IgM. In different 
      age groups, seropositive rates varied from 12.50% to 50.00% for DENV IgM, and from 
      0% to 11.76% for DENV IgG. Seroprevalence of DENV IgM was significantly higher than 
      that of DENV IgG. Seroprevalence rates of DENV IgM differed among different 
      villages. However, the seroprevalence of DENV IgM was not statistically 
      significantly different among gender and age groups. Asymptomatic DF infection is 
      prevalent in non-endemic areas.

AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a more serious form of disease characterised by plasma 
      leakage syndrome, thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. We 
      present a 51 year old male who presented with fever, petechiae and acute onset of 
      breathlessness. Emergency chest rhoentogram showed a massive right sided pleural 
      effusion. On insertion of intercostal drain, there was a sudden gush of blood tinged 
      fluid suggestive of hemothorax. There was no history of trauma or bleeding 
      tendencies. Laboratory investigations revealed a raised hematocrit and severe 
      thrombocytopenia. Dengue IgM was surprisingly positive. After aggressive supportive 
      management the patient gradually improved and was discharged. While bilateral 
      pleural effusion is a known occurrence in dengue hemorrhagic fever, massive 
      hemothorax is unheard of. We report the first case in literature of dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever presenting as unilateral massive hemothorax. A suspicion of dengue 
      must also be borne in mind in cases of non-traumatic hemothorax especially in 
      endemic areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue diagnosis is complex and until recently only specialized 
      laboratories were able to definitively confirm dengue infection. Rapid tests are now 
      available commercially making biological diagnosis possible in the field. The aim of 
      this study was to evaluate a combined dengue rapid test for the detection of NS1 and 
      IgM/IgG antibodies. The evaluation was made prospectively in the field conditions 
      and included the study of the impact of its use as a point-of-care test for case 
      management as well as retrospectively against a panel of well-characterized samples 
      in a reference laboratory. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the prospective 
      study, 157 patients hospitalized for a suspicion of dengue were enrolled. In the 
      hospital laboratories, the overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the 
      NS1/IgM/IgG combination tests were 85.7%, 83.9%, 95.6% and 59.1% respectively, 
      whereas they were 94,4%, 90.0%, 97.5% and 77.1% respectively in the national 
      reference laboratory at Institut Pasteur in Cambodia. These results demonstrate that 
      optimal performances require adequate training and quality assurance. The 
      retrospective study showed that the sensitivity of the combined kit did not vary 
      significantly between the serotypes and was not affected by the immune status or by 
      the interval of time between onset of fever and sample collection. The analysis of 
      the medical records indicates that the physicians did not take into consideration 
      the results obtained with the rapid test including for care management and use of 
      antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of our prospective field study, we 
      demonstrated that if the SD Bioline Dengue Duo kit is correctly used, a positive 
      result highly suggests a dengue case but a negative result doesn't rule out a dengue 
      infection. Nevertheless, Cambodian pediatricians in their daily practice relied on 
      their clinical diagnosis and thus the false negative results obtained did not 
      directly impact on the clinical management.

AB  - Persistent high fever is one of the most typical clinical symptoms in dengue virus 
      (DV)-infected patients. However, the source of endogenous pyrogen (eg, IL-1β) and 
      the signaling cascade leading to the activation of inflammasome and caspase-1, which 
      are essential for IL-1β and IL-18 secretion, during dengue infection have not been 
      elucidated yet. Macrophages can be polarized into distinct phenotypes under the 
      influence of GM-CSF or M-CSF, denoted as GM-Mϕ and M-Mϕ, respectively. We found that 
      DV induced high levels of IL-1β and IL-18 from GM-Mϕ (inflammatory macrophage) and 
      caused cell death (pyroptosis), whereas M-Mϕ (resting macrophage) did not produce 
      IL-1β and IL-18 on DV infection even with lipopolysaccharide priming. This 
      observation demonstrates the distinct responses of GM-Mϕ and M-Mϕ to DV infection. 
      Moreover, up-regulation of pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and NLRP3 associated with caspase-1 
      activation was observed in DV-infected GM-Mϕ, whereas blockade of CLEC5A/MDL-1, a 
      C-type lectin critical for dengue hemorrhagic fever and Japanese encephalitis virus 
      infection, inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyrotopsis in GM-Mϕ. Thus, DV 
      can activate NLRP3 inflammasome via CLEC5A, and GM-Mϕ plays a more important role 
      than M-Mϕ in the pathogenesis of DV infection.

AB  - Dengue is a serious disease transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti during blood 
      meal feeding. It is estimated that the dengue virus is transmitted to millions of 
      individuals each year in tropical and subtropical areas. Dengue control strategies 
      have been based on controlling the vector, Ae. aegypti, using insecticide, but the 
      emergence of resistance poses new challenges. The aim of this study was the 
      identification of specific protease inhibitors of the digestive enzymes from Ae. 
      aegypti larvae, which may serve as a prospective alternative biocontrol method. High 
      affinity protein inhibitors were selected by all of the digestive serine proteases 
      of the 4th instar larval midgut, and the specificity of these inhibitors was 
      characterized. These inhibitors were obtained from a phage library displaying 
      variants of HiTI, a trypsin inhibitor from Haematobia irritans, that are mutated in 
      the reactive loop (P1-P4'). Based on the selected amino acid sequence pattern, seven 
      HiTI inhibitor variants were cloned, expressed and purified. The results indicate 
      that the HiTI variants named T6 (RGGAV) and T128 (WNEGL) were selected by larval 
      trypsin-like (IC(50) of 1.1 nM) and chymotrypsin-like enzymes (IC(50) of 11.6 nM), 
      respectively. The variants T23 (LLGGL) and T149 (GGVWR) inhibited both larval 
      chymotrypsin-like (IC(50) of 4.2 nM and 29.0 nM, respectively) and elastase-like 
      enzymes (IC(50) of 1.2 nM for both). Specific inhibitors were successfully obtained 
      for the digestive enzymes of Ae. aegypti larvae by phage display. Our data also 
      strongly suggest the presence of elastase-like enzymes in Ae. aegypti larvae. The 
      HiTI variants T6 and T23 are good candidates for the development as a larvicide to 
      control the vector.

AB  - Ever since Richards proposed his flexible growth function more than half a century 
      ago, it has been a mystery that this empirical function has made many incredible 
      coincidences with real ecological or epidemic data even though one of its parameters 
      (i.e., the exponential term) does not seem to have clear biological meaning. It is 
      therefore a natural challenge to mathematical biologists to provide an explanation 
      of the interesting coincidences and a biological interpretation of the parameter. 
      Here we start from a simple epidemic SIR model to revisit Richards model via an 
      intrinsic relation between both models. Especially, we prove that the exponential 
      term in the Richards model has a one-to-one nonlinear correspondence to the basic 
      reproduction number of the SIR model. This one-to-one relation provides us an 
      explicit formula in calculating the basic reproduction number. Another biological 
      significance of our study is the observation that the peak time is approximately 
      just a serial interval after the turning point. Moreover, we provide an explicit 
      relation between final outbreak size, basic reproduction number and the peak 
      epidemic size which means that we can predict the final outbreak size shortly after 
      the peak time. Finally, we introduce a constraint in Richards model to address over 
      fitting problem observed in the existing studies and then apply our method with 
      constraint to conduct some validation analysis using the data of recent outbreaks of 
      prototype infectious diseases such as Canada 2009 H1N1 outbreak, GTA 2003 SARS 
      outbreak, Singapore 2005 dengue outbreak, and Taiwan 2003 SARS outbreak. Our new 
      formula gives much more stable and precise estimate of model parameters and key 
      epidemic characteristics such as the final outbreak size, the basic reproduction 
      number, and the turning point, compared with earlier simulations without 
      constraints.

TI  - Protective immunity to DENV2 after immunization with a recombinant NS1 protein using 
      a genetically detoxified heat-labile toxin as an adjuvant.
PG  - 837-45
LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.12.034 [doi]
AB  - The dengue virus non-structural 1 (NS1) protein contributes to evasion of host 
      immune defenses and represents a target for immune responses. Evidences generated in 
      experimental models, as well as the immune responses elicited by infected 
      individuals, showed that induction of anti-NS1 immunity correlates with protective 
      immunity but may also result in the generation of cross-reactive antibodies that 
      recognize platelets and proteins involved in the coagulation cascade. In the present 
      work, we evaluated the immune responses, protection to type 2 dengue virus (DENV2) 
      challenges and safety parameters in BALB/c mice vaccinated with a recombinant NS1 
      protein in combination with three different adjuvants: aluminum hydroxide (alum), 
      Freund's adjuvant (FA) or a genetically detoxified derivative of the heat-labile 
      toxin (LT(G33D)), originally produced by some enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 
      (ETEC) strains. Mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) immunized with different vaccine 
      formulations and the induced NS1-specific responses, including serum antibodies and 
      T cell responses, were measured. Mice were also subjected to lethal challenges with 
      the DENV2 NGC strain. The results showed that maximal protective immunity (50%) was 
      achieved in mice vaccinated with NS1 in combination with LT(G33D). Analyses of the 
      NS1-specific immune responses showed that the anti-virus protection correlated 
      mainly with the serum anti-NS1 antibody responses including higher avidity to the 
      target antigen. Mice immunized with LT(G33D) elicited a prevailing IgG2a subclass 
      response and generated antibodies with stronger affinity to the antigen than those 
      generated in mice immunized with the other vaccine formulations. The vaccine 
      formulations were also evaluated regarding induction of deleterious side effects 
      and, in contrast to mice immunized with the FA-adjuvanted vaccine, no significant 
      hepatic damage or enhanced C-reactive protein levels were detected in mice immunized 
      with NS1 and LT(G33D.) Similarly, no detectable alterations in bleeding time and 
      hematological parameters were detected in mice vaccinated with NS1 and LT(G33D). 
      Altogether, these results indicate that the combination of a purified recombinant 
      NS1 and a nontoxic LT derivative is a promising alternative for the generation of 
      safe and effective protein-based anti-dengue vaccine.

TI  - Human monoclonal antibodies to neutralize all dengue virus serotypes using 
      lymphocytes from patients at acute phase of the secondary infection.
PG  - 867-72
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.06.057 [doi]
AB  - The global spread of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 to -4) has made this 
      virus a major and growing public health concern. Generally, pre-existing 
      neutralizing antibodies derived from primary infection play a significant role in 
      protecting against subsequent infection with the same serotype. By contrast, these 
      pre-existing antibodies are believed to mediate a non-protective response to 
      subsequent heterotypic DENV infections, leading to the onset of dengue illness. In 
      this study, we prepared hybridomas producing human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) 
      against DENV using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients in the 
      acute phase (around 1 week after the onset of illness) or the convalescent phase 
      (around 2weeks after the onset of illness) of secondary infection. Interestingly, a 
      larger number of hybridoma clones was obtained from patients in the acute phase than 
      from those in the convalescent phase. Most HuMAbs from acute-phase infections were 
      cross-reactive with all four DENV serotypes and showed significant neutralization 
      activity to all four DENV serotypes. Thus, secondary DENV infection plays a 
      significant role in stimulating memory cells to transiently increase the number of 
      antibody-secreting plasma cells in patients in the early phase after the secondary 
      infection. These HuMAbs will enable us to better understand the protective and 
      pathogenic effects of DENV infection, which could vary greatly among 
      secondarily-infected individuals.

AB  - Heme oxygenase (HO)-1, the inducible isoform of the first and rate-limiting enzyme 
      of heme degradation, affords anti-inflammatory protection via its cell-type-specific 
      effects in endothelial cells (ECs). In dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which is the 
      life-threatening form of dengue virus (DV) infection, endothelial interactions of 
      cross-reactive antibodies against the DV nonstructural glycoprotein-1 (NS1) are 
      associated with endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we investigated whether 
      anti-NS1 antibodies might regulate HO-1 gene expression in human ECs. Serum from DHF 
      patients with high anti-NS1 titers and a monoclonal anti-NS1 antibody upregulated 
      HO-1 gene expression in human umbilical vein ECs, which was blocked by purified NS1 
      antigen. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that anti-NS1 antibodies specifically 
      bound to the oxidoreductase protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) on ECs. Moreover, 
      anti-NS1-mediated HO-1 induction was reduced by inhibition of PDI enzyme activity. 
      Reactive oxygen species, which were generated by NADPH oxidase and in turn activated 
      the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt cascade, were involved in this 
      upregulation of HO-1 gene expression. Finally, apoptosis of ECs caused by anti-NS1 
      antibodies was increased by pharmacological inhibition of HO-1 enzyme activity. In 
      conclusion, HO-1 gene expression is upregulated by anti-NS1 antibodies via 
      activation of a redox-dependent PDI/PI3K/Akt-mediated pathway in human ECs.

AB  - Viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family are found and distributed in most of 
      the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. The genus has more than 56 
      members, most of which cause clinical symptoms in humans. The clinical diagnosis of 
      dengue requires laboratory confirmation because of the similarity of symptoms with a 
      series of other acute fevers and the primary use antibodies or antigens for 
      detection. In this work, peptides E(1) and E(2) of the envelope protein (E) of the 
      dengue virus were mapped using bioinformatics methods. These peptides were then 
      expressed in a prokaryotic system and purified. An indirect ELISA for antibodies IgG 
      and IgM from laboratory samples previously characterised was then used with the 
      peptides to detect anti-dengue antibodies. For IgG using the peptide E(1), the 
      sensitivity of the indirect ELISA was 88.3% and the specificity was 56%; using the 
      peptide E(2), the sensitivity was 90% and the specificity was 59%; and using a 
      combination of both peptides, the sensitivity was 93.3% and the specificity was 78%. 
      For IgM using the peptide E(1), the sensitivity was 88% and the specificity was 66%; 
      using the peptide E(2), the sensitivity was 88% and the specificity was 69%; and 
      when used in combination, the peptides E(1)/E(2) demonstrated a sensitivity of 90% 
      and a specificity of 86%. These results indicate that the use of the E(1) and E(2) 
      peptides of the E protein are an alternative for serological diagnosis of dengue 
      fever.

AB  - Hemorrhage is one of the hallmarks of dengue hemorrhagic fever. However, the 
      mechanisms that cause hemorrhage are unclear. In this review we focus on the 
      possible factors that may be involved in the disturbance of coagulation and 
      fibrinolysis during dengue virus (DENV) infection. Factors such as autoantibodies 
      and cytokines induced by DENV infection as well as hemostatic molecules expressed on 
      DENV-infected cells, and DENV viral proteins may all contribute to the defect of 
      hemostasis during DENV infection. It is the combination of these viral and host 
      factors that may tilt the balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis toward bleeding in 
      dengue patients.

AB  - Dengue virus is the most significant virus transmitted by arthropods worldwide and 
      may cause a potentially fatal systemic disease named dengue hemorrhagic fever. In 
      this work, dengue virus serotype 4 was detected in the tissues of one fatal dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever case using electron immunomicroscopy and molecular methods. This 
      is the first report of dengue virus polypeptides findings by electron 
      immunomicroscopy in human samples. In addition, not-previously-documented virus-like 
      particles visualized in spleen, hepatic, brain, and pulmonary tissues from a dengue 
      case are discussed.

AB  - A biological method was used to synthesize stable silver nanoparticles that were 
      tested as mosquito larvicides against Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and Culex 
      quinquefasciatus. Annona squamosa leaf broth (5%) reduced aqueous 1 mM AgNO₃ to 
      stable silver nanoparticles with an average size of 450 nm. The structure and 
      percentage of synthesized nanoparticles was characterized by using ultraviolet 
      spectrophotometry, X-Ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and 
      scanning electron microscopy methods. The median lethal concentrations (LC₅₀) of 
      silver nanoparticles that killed fourth instars of Ae. aegypti, Cx. 
      quinquefasciatus, and An. stephensi were 0.30, 0.41, and 2.12 ppm, respectively. 
      Adult longevity (days) in male and female mosquitoes exposed as larvae to 0.1 ppm 
      silver nanoparticles was reduced by ~30% (p<0.05), whereas the number of eggs laid 
      by females exposed as larvae to 0.1 ppm silver nanoparticles decreased by 36% 
      (p<0.05).

TI  - Interaction of dengue virus nonstructural protein 5 with Daxx modulates RANTES 
      production.

AB  - Dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), 
      caused by dengue virus (DENV) infection, are important public health problems in the 
      tropical and subtropical regions. Abnormal hemostasis and plasma leakage are the 
      main patho-physiological changes in DHF/DSS. A remarkably increased production of 
      cytokines, the so called 'cytokine storm', is observed in the patients with DHF/DSS. 
      A complex interaction between DENV proteins and the host immune response contributes 
      to cytokine production. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which DENV 
      nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) mediates these responses has not been fully 
      elucidated. In the present study, yeast two-hybrid assay was performed to identify 
      host proteins interacting with DENV NS5 and a death-domain-associate protein (Daxx) 
      was identified. The in vivo relevance of this interaction was suggested by 
      co-immunoprecipitation and nuclear co-localization of these two proteins in HEK293 
      cells expressing DENV NS5. HEK293 cells expressing DENV NS5-K/A, which were mutated 
      at the nuclear localization sequences (NLS), were created to assess its functional 
      roles in nuclear translocation, Daxx interaction, and cytokine production. In the 
      absence of NLS, DENV NS5 could neither translocate into the nucleus nor interact 
      with Daxx to increase the DHF-associated cytokine, RANTES (CCL5) production. This 
      work demonstrates the interaction between DENV NS5 and Daxx and the role of the 
      interaction on the modulation of RANTES production.

AB  - The larvicidal activity of hydrodistillate extracts from Mentha piperita L. Ocimum 
      basilicum L. Curcuma longa L. and Zingiber officinale L. were investigated against 
      the dengue vector Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae).The results indicated that 
      the mortality rates at 80, 100, 200 and 400 ppm of M. piperita, Z. officinale, C. 
      longa and O. basilicum concentrations were highest amongst all concentrations of the 
      crude extracts tested against all the larval instars and pupae of A. aegypti. Result 
      of log probit analysis (at 95% confidence level) revealed that lethal concentration 
      LC₅₀ and LC₉₀ values were 47.54 and 86.54 ppm for M. piperita, 40.5 and 85.53 ppm 
      for Z. officinale, 115.6 and 193.3 ppm for C. longa and 148.5 and 325.7 ppm for O. 
      basilicum, respectively. All of the tested oils proved to have strong larvicidal 
      activity (doses from 5 to 350 ppm) against A. aegypti fourth instars, with the most 
      potent oil being M. piperita extract, followed by Z. officinale, C. longa and O. 
      basilicum. In general, early instars were more susceptible than the late instars and 
      pupae. The results achieved suggest that, in addition to their medicinal activities, 
      Lamiaceae and Zingiberaceae plant extracts may also serve as a natural larvicidal 
      agent.

AB  - The current treatment for dengue hemorrhagic fever largely consists of supportive 
      care. The drug pentoxifylline has been shown to blunt the proinflammatory actions of 
      tumor necrosis factor-α, a key mediator of dengue hemorrhagic fever. We performed a 
      pilot study evaluating pentoxifylline's effect on 55 children with dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever. We believe our findings support the existing literature on its 
      potential use in severe infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a severe form of dengue, characterized 
      by bleeding and plasma leakage. A number of DHF risk factors had been suggested. 
      However, these risk factors may not be generalized to all populations and epidemics 
      for screening and clinical management of patients at risk of developing DHF. This 
      study explored demographic and comorbidity risk factors for DHF in adult dengue 
      epidemics in Singapore in year 2006 (predominantly serotype 1) and in year 2007-2008 
      (predominantly serotype 2). METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was 
      conducted with 149 DHF and 326 dengue fever (DF) patients from year 2006, and 669 
      DHF and 1,141 DF patients from year 2007-2008. Demographic and reported comorbidity 
      data were collected from patients previously. We performed multivariate logistic 
      regression to assess the association between DHF and demographic and co-morbidities 
      for year 2006 and year 2007-2008, respectively. RESULTS: Only Chinese (adjusted odds 
      ratio [AOR] = 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.56) was independently 
      associated with DHF in year 2006. In contrast, age groups of 30-39 years 
      (AOR = 1.41; 95% CI:1.09-1.81), 40-49 years (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI:1.09-1.81), female 
      (AOR = 1.57; 95% CI:1.28-1.94), Chinese (AOR = 1.67; 95% CI:1.24-2.24), diabetes 
      (AOR = 1.78; 95% CI:1.06-2.97), and diabetes with hypertension (AOR = 2.16; 
      95%CI:1.18-3.96) were independently associated with DHF in year 2007-2008. 
      Hypertension was proposed to have effect modification on the risk of DHF outcome in 
      dengue patients with diabetes. Chinese who had diabetes with hypertension had 2.1 
      (95% CI:1.07-4.12) times higher risk of DHF compared with Chinese who had no 
      diabetes and no hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Adult dengue patients in Singapore who 
      were 30-49 years, Chinese, female, had diabetes or diabetes with hypertension were 
      at greater risk of developing DHF during epidemic of predominantly serotype 2. These 
      risk factors can be used to guide triaging of patients who require closer clinical 
      monitoring and early hospitalization in Singapore, when confirmed in more studies.

TI  - Protection from secondary dengue virus infection in a mouse model reveals the role 
      of serotype cross-reactive B and T cells.
PG  - 404-16
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1102124 [doi]
AB  - The four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes cause dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic 
      fever/dengue shock syndrome. Although severe disease has been associated with 
      heterotypic secondary DENV infection, most secondary DENV infections are 
      asymptomatic or result in classic DF. The role of cross-reactive immunity in 
      mediating cross-protection against secondary heterotypic DENV infection is not well 
      understood. DENV infection of IFN-α/β and IFN-γ receptor-deficient (AG129) mice 
      reproduces key features of human disease. We previously demonstrated a role in 
      cross-protection for pre-existing cross-reactive Abs, maintained by long-lived 
      plasma cells. In this study, we use a sequential infection model, infecting AG129 
      mice with DENV-1, followed by DENV-2 6-8 wk later. We find that increased 
      DENV-specific avidity during acute secondary heterotypic infection is mediated by 
      cross-reactive memory B cells, as evidenced by increased numbers of DENV-1-specific 
      cells by ELISPOT and higher avidity against DENV-1 of supernatants from polyclonally 
      stimulated splenocytes isolated from mice experiencing secondary DENV-2 infection. 
      However, increased DENV-specific avidity is not associated with increased 
      DENV-specific neutralization, which appears to be mediated by naive B cells. 
      Adoptive transfer of DENV-1-immune B and T cells into naive mice prior to secondary 
      DENV-2 infection delayed mortality. Mice depleted of T cells developed signs of 
      disease, but recovered after secondary DENV infection. Overall, we found that 
      protective cross-reactive Abs are secreted by both long-lived plasma cells and 
      memory B cells and that both cross-reactive B cells and T cells provide protection 
      against a secondary heterotypic DENV infection. Understanding the protective 
      immunity that develops naturally against DENV infection may help design future 
      vaccines.

LID - S1020-49892012000700001 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of increasing larval rearing temperatures on the 
      resistance status of Trinidadian populations of Aedes aegypti to organophosphate 
      (OP) insecticides. METHODS: In 2007-2008, bioassays and biochemical assays were 
      conducted on A. aegypti larvae collected in 2006 from eight geographically distinct 
      areas in Trinidad (Trinidad and Tobago). Larval populations were reared at four 
      temperatures (28 ± 2ºC, 32ºC, 34ºC, and 36ºC) prior to bioassays with OP 
      insecticides (fenthion, malathion, and temephos) and biochemical assays for esterase 
      enzymes. RESULTS: Most larval populations reared at 28 ± 2ºC were susceptible to 
      fenthion (>98% mortality) but resistant to malathion and temephos (< 80% mortality). 
      A positive association was found between resistance to OP insecticides and increased 
      activities of α- and β-esterases in larval populations reared at 28 ± 2ºC. Although 
      larval populations reared at higher temperatures showed variations in resistance to 
      OPs, there was a general increase in susceptibility. However, increases or decreases 
      in activity levels of enzymes did not always correspond with an increase or decrease 
      in the proportion of resistant individuals reared at higher temperatures. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although global warming may cause an increase in dengue transmission, 
      based on the current results, the use of insecticides for dengue prevention and 
      control may yet be effective if temperatures increase as projected.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue viruses (DENV) are the most important arboviruses of humans and 
      cause significant disease. Infection with DENV elicits antibody responses to the 
      envelope glycoprotein, predominantly against immunodominant, cross-reactive, 
      weakly-neutralizing epitopes. These weakly-neutralizing antibodies are implicated in 
      enhancing infection via Fcγ receptor bearing cells and can lead to increased viral 
      loads that are associated with severe disease. Here we describe results from the 
      development and testing of cross-reactivity reduced DENV-2 DNA vaccine candidates 
      that contain substitutions in immunodominant B cell epitopes of the fusion peptide 
      and domain III of the envelope protein. RESULTS: Cross-reactivity reduced and 
      wild-type vaccine candidates were similarly immunogenic in outbred mice and elicited 
      high levels of neutralizing antibody, however mice immunized with cross-reactivity 
      reduced vaccines produced significantly reduced levels of immunodominant 
      cross-reactive antibodies. Sera from mice immunized with wild-type, fusion peptide-, 
      or domain III- substitution containing vaccines enhanced heterologous DENV infection 
      in vitro, unlike sera from mice immunized with a vaccine containing a combination of 
      both fusion peptide and domain III substitutions. Passive transfer of immune sera 
      from mice immunized with fusion peptide and domain III substitutions also reduced 
      the development of severe DENV disease in AG129 mice when compared to mice receiving 
      wild type immune sera. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing cross-reactivity in the envelope 
      glycoprotein of DENV may be an approach to improve the quality of the anti-DENV 
      immune response.

TI  - Dengue-3 encephalitis promotes anxiety-like behavior in mice.
PG  - 237-42
LID - 10.1016/j.bbr.2012.02.020 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus is a human pathogen that may cause meningoencephalitis and other 
      neurological syndromes. The current study investigated anxiety-like behavior and 
      expression of proinflammatory cytokines and pro-apoptotic caspase-3 in the 
      hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice infected with non-adapted Dengue virus 3 genotype I 
      (DENV-3) inoculated intracranially with 4×10(3) (plaque-forming unit) PFU. 
      Anxiety-like behavior was assessed in control and DENV-3 infected mice using the 
      elevated plus maze. The open field test was performed to evaluate locomotor 
      activity. Histopathological changes in CA regions of the hippocampus were assessed 
      by haematoxylin and eosin staining. Immunoreactive and protein levels of cleaved 
      caspase-3 were also analyzed in the hippocampus. The mRNA expression of IL-6 and 
      TNF-α in the hippocampus were estimated by quantitative real time (polymerase chain 
      reaction) PCR. All procedures were conducted on day 5 post-infection. We found that 
      DENV-3 infected mice presented higher levels of anxiety in comparison with controls 
      (p≤0.05). No difference in motor activity was found between groups (p=0.77). The 
      infection was followed by a significant increase of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expression 
      in the hippocampus (p≤0.05). Histological analysis demonstrated meningoencephalitis 
      with formation of perivascular cuffs, infiltration of immune cells and loss of 
      neurons at CA regions of hippocampus. Numerous caspase-3 positive neurons were 
      visualized at CA areas in DENV-3 infected mice. Marked increase of cleaved caspase-3 
      levels were observed after infection. This study described anxiety-like behavior, 
      hippocampal inflammation and neuronal apoptosis associated with DENV-3 infection in 
      the central nervous system.

AB  - The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1-DENV-4) have a large impact on global 
      health, causing 50-100 million cases of dengue fever annually. Herein, we describe 
      the first kinetic T cell response to a low-dose DENV-1 vaccination study (10 PFU) in 
      humans. Using flow cytometry, we found that proinflammatory cytokines, IFNγ, TNFα, 
      and IL-2, were generated by DENV-1-specific CD4(+) cells 21 days post-DENV-1 
      exposure, and their production continued through the latest time-point, day 42 
      (p<0.0001 for all cytokines). No statistically significant changes were observed at 
      any time-points for IL-10 (p = 0.19), a regulatory cytokine, indicating that the 
      response to DENV-1 was primarily proinflammatory in nature. We also observed little 
      T cell cross-reactivity to the other 3 DENV serotypes. The percentage of 
      multifunctional T cells (T cells making ≥ 2 cytokines simultaneously) increased with 
      time post-DENV-1 exposure (p<0.0001). The presence of multifunctional T cells 
      together with neutralizing antibody data suggest that the immune response generated 
      to the vaccine may be protective. This work provides an initial framework for 
      defining primary T cell responses to each DENV serotype and will enhance the 
      evaluation of a tetravalent DENV vaccine.

PG  - 224-30
LID - S0074-02762012000200012 [pii]
AB  - Severe forms of dengue, such as dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock 
      syndrome, are examples of a complex pathogenic mechanism in which the virus, 
      environment and host immune response interact. The influence of the host's genetic 
      predisposition to susceptibility or resistance to infectious diseases has been 
      evidenced in several studies. The association of the human leukocyte antigen gene 
      (HLA) class I alleles with DHF susceptibility or resistance has been reported in 
      ethnically and geographically distinct populations. Due to these ethnic and viral 
      strain differences, associations occur in each population, independently with a 
      specific allele, which most likely explains the associations of several alleles with 
      DHF. As the potential role of HLA alleles in the progression of DHF in Brazilian 
      patients remains unknown, we then identified HLA-A alleles in 67 patients with 
      dengue fever and 42 with DHF from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, selected from 2002-2008 by 
      the sequence-based typing technique. Statistical analysis revealed an association 
      between the HLA-A*01 allele and DHF [odds ratio (OR) = 2.7, p = 0.01], while 
      analysis of the HLA-A*31 allele (OR = 0.5, p = 0.11) suggested a potential 
      protective role in DHF that should be further investigated. This study provides 
      evidence that HLA class I alleles might be important risk factors for DHF in 
      Brazilian patients.

      epitopes on dengue NS1 protein.
PG  - 207-18
LID - 10.1093/intimm/dxr115 [doi]
AB  - Immunopathogenesis of dengue virus (DEN) infection remains poorly studied. 
      Identification and characterization of human CD8(+) T-cell epitopes on DEN are 
      necessary for a better understanding of the immunopathogenesis of dengue infection 
      and would facilitate the development of immunotherapy and vaccines to protect from 
      dengue infection. Here, we identified two new HLA-A*0201-restricted CD8(+) T-cell 
      epitopes, DEN-4 NS1(990)(-998) and DEN-4 NS1(997)(-1005) that are conserved in three 
      or four major DEN serotypes, respectively. Unexpectedly, we found that immunization 
      of HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice with DEN-4 NS1(990)(-998) or DEN-4 NS1(997)(-1005) 
      epitope peptide induced de novo synthesis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and 
      IFN-γ, two important pro-inflammatory molecules that are hard to be detected 
      directly without in vitro antigenic re-stimulation. Importantly, we demonstrated 
      that CD8(+) T cells specifically activated by DEN-4 NS1(990)(-998) or DEN-4 
      NS1(997)(-1005) epitope peptide induced de novo synthesis of perforin. Furthermore, 
      we observed that DEN-4 NS1(990)(-998) or DEN-4 NS1(997)(-1005)-specific CD8(+) T 
      cells capable of producing large amounts of perforin, TNF-α and IFN-γ preferentially 
      displayed CD27(+)CD45RA(-), but not CD27(-)CD45RA(+), phenotypes. This study, 
      therefore, suggested the importance of synergistic effects of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines and cytotoxic molecules which were produced by dengue-specific CD8(+) T 
      cells in immunopathogenesis or anti-dengue immunity during dengue infection.

TI  - Differential targeting of viral components by CD4+ versus CD8+ T lymphocytes in 
      dengue virus infection.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the principal arthropod-borne viral pathogen afflicting human 
      populations. While repertoires of antibodies to DENV have been linked to protection 
      or enhanced infection, the role of T lymphocytes in these processes remains poorly 
      defined. This study provides a comprehensive overview of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell 
      epitope reactivities against the DENV 2 proteome in adult patients experiencing 
      secondary DENV infection. Dengue virus-specific T cell responses directed against an 
      overlapping 15mer peptide library spanning the DENV 2 proteome were analyzed ex vivo 
      by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay, and recognition of individual peptides 
      was further characterized in specific T cell lines. Thirty novel T cell epitopes 
      were identified, 9 of which are CD4(+) and 21 are CD8(+) T cell epitopes. We observe 
      that whereas CD8(+) T cell epitopes preferentially target nonstructural proteins 
      (NS3 and NS5), CD4(+) epitopes are skewed toward recognition of viral components 
      that are also targeted by B lymphocytes (envelope, capsid, and NS1). Consistently, a 
      large proportion of dengue virus-specific CD4(+) T cells have phenotypic 
      characteristics of circulating follicular helper T cells (CXCR5 expression and 
      production of interleukin-21 or gamma interferon), suggesting that they are 
      interacting with B cells in vivo. This study shows that during a dengue virus 
      infection, the protein targets of human CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are largely 
      distinct, thus highlighting key differences in the immunodominance of DENV proteins 
      for these two cell types. This has important implications for our understanding of 
      how the two arms of the human adaptive immune system are differentially targeted and 
      employed as part of our response to DENV infection.

TI  - Betel quid use in relation to infectious disease outcomes in Cambodia.
PG  - e262-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ijid.2011.12.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The habitual chewing of betel quid (areca nut, betel leaf, tobacco) is 
      estimated to occur among 600 million persons in Asia and the Asia-Pacific Region. 
      Emerging data from rural Asia indicate that the betel quid is part of traditional 
      medicine practices that promote its use for a wide range of ailments, including 
      infectious disease. In the present study, we examined the association between betel 
      quid, traditional medicine, and infectious disease outcomes. METHODS: For the 
      purpose of a nationwide, interviewer-administered, cross-sectional survey of tobacco 
      use (including betel quid), we conducted a stratified three-stage cluster sampling 
      of 13 988 adults aged 18 years and older from all provinces of Cambodia. RESULTS: We 
      found an association between the intensity of betel quid use and HIV/AIDS (odds 
      ratio (OR) 2.06, 95% CI 1.09-3.89), dengue fever (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.55-2.72), 
      tuberculosis (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.96-2.36), and typhoid (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.95-2.30). 
      These associations were even stronger in women - the primary users of betel quid in 
      Cambodia. Multivariable analyses that controlled for age, gender, income, education, 
      urban versus rural dwelling, receiving care from traditional medicine practitioners, 
      and cigarette smoking did not alter the betel quid-infectious disease association. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings raise the possibility of a role of betel quid use in the 
      transmission of infectious disease through pathways such as immunosuppression, oral 
      route of entry for a pathogen (i.e., through injury to the oral mucosa), and 
      contamination (i.e., fecal-oral) of the betel quid ingredients.

TI  - Laboratory observations on the larvicidal efficacy of three plant species against 
      mosquito vectors of malaria, dengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) and lymphatic 
      filariasis in the semi-arid desert.
PG  - 617-21
AB  - Comparative larvicidal efficacy of aqueous and organic solvent extracts from seeds, 
      leaves and flowers of three desert plants viz. Calotropis procera (Aiton), Tephrosia 
      purpurea (L.) Pers. and Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC. was evaluated against Anopheles 
      stephensi (Liston), Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say). For 
      this purpose larvae of all the three mosquito species were reared in the laboratory 
      and studies carried out on late 3rd or early 4th instars using standard WHO 
      technique. Based on concentration mortality data 24 and 48 hr LC50and LC90 values 
      along with their 95% fiducial limits, regression equation, chi-square (chi2)/ 
      heterogeneity of the response were determined by log probit regression analysis. 
      Experiments were carried out with different solvent extracts of seeds of C. procera 
      which revealed that methanol (24 hr LC50: 127.2, 194.8, 361.0) and acetone (229.9, 
      368.1,193.0 mg l(-1)) extracts were more effective with the three mosquito species, 
      respectively. Petroleum ether extract was effective only on An. stephensi while 
      aqueous extracts were not effective at all with any of the mosquito species 
      (mortality < 10-30%). Tests carried out with methanol extracts of fresh leaves (24 
      hr LC50: 89.2, 171.2, 369.7) and flowers (24 hr LC50: 94.7,617.3, 1384.0 mg l-(-1)) 
      of Calotropis showed that preparations from fresh parts were 2-3 times more 
      effective as compared to the stored plant parts. Efficacy was less than 10-30% with 
      both An. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus while An. stephensi was still susceptible 
      to extracts from both leaves and flowers even after two years of storage. The 24 hr 
      LC50 values as observed for methanol extracts of seeds of T. purpurea and leaves of 
      P. juliflora were 74.9, 63.2 and 47.0 and 96.2,128.1 and 118.8 mg l(-1) for the 
      above three mosquito species, respectively. Experiments carried out up to 500 mg 
      l-(1) with leaves (T. purpurea) and seeds (P. juliflora) extracts show only up to 
      10-30% mortality indicating that active larvicidal principle may be present only in 
      the seeds of Tephrosia and leaves of Prosopis. In general, anophelines were found 
      more susceptible than the culicines to the plant derived derivatives. More studies 
      are being carried outon some other desert plants found in this arid region. The 
      study would be of great importance while formulating vector control strategy based 
      on alternative plant based insecticides in this semi-arid region.

TI  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever-associated immunomediators induced via maturation of dengue 
      virus nonstructural 4B protein in monocytes modulate endothelial cell adhesion 
      molecules and human microvascular endothelial cells permeability.
PG  - 326-37
LID - 10.1016/j.virol.2011.10.030 [doi]
AB  - We previously demonstrated that dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural 4B protein (NS4B) 
      induced dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)-associated immunomediators in THP-1 
      monocytes. Moreover, cleavage of NS4AB polyprotein by the NS2B3 protease, 
      significantly increased immunomediator production to levels found after DENV 
      infection. In this report using primary human microvascular endothelial cells 
      (HMVEC) transwell permeability model and HMVEC monolayer, we demonstrate that the 
      immunomediators secreted in the supernatants of DENV-infected monocytes increase 
      HMVEC permeability and expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin. Moreover, 
      maturation of NS4B via cleavage of 2KNS4B is sufficient to induce immunomediators 
      that cause HMVEC phenotypic changes, which appear to be synergistically induced by 
      TNFα and IL-8. These data suggest that therapies targeting the maturation steps of 
      NS4B, particularly 2KNS4B processing, may reduce overall DHF-associated 
      immunomediator levels, thereby reducing DHF-associated morbidity and mortality. 
      Alternatively, TNFα inhibitors may be a valid intervention strategy during the later 
      stages of infection to prevent DHF progression.

TI  - Expression profile of genes during resistance reversal in a temephos selected strain 
      of the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti.
PG  - e39439

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mosquito Aedes aegypti is one of the most important disease vectors 
      because it transmits two major arboviruses, dengue and yellow fever, which cause 
      significant global morbidity and mortality. Chemical insecticides form the 
      cornerstone of vector control. The organophosphate temephos a larvicide recommended 
      by WHO for controlling Ae. aegypti, however, resistance to this compound has been 
      reported in many countries, including Brazil. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The 
      aim of this study was to identify genes implicated in metabolic resistance in an Ae. 
      aegypti temephos resistant strain, named RecR, through microarray analysis. We 
      utilized a custom 'Ae. aegypti detox chip' and validated microarray data through 
      RT-PCR comparing susceptible and resistant individuals. In addition, we analyzed 
      gene expression in 4(th) instar larvae from a reversed susceptible strain (RecRev), 
      exposed and unexposed to temephos. The results obtained revealed a set of 13 and 6 
      genes significantly over expressed in resistant adult mosquitoes and larvae, 
      respectively. One of these genes, the cytochrome P450 CYP6N12, was up-regulated in 
      both stages. RT-PCR confirmed the microarray results and, additionally, showed no 
      difference in gene expression between temephos exposed and unexposed RecRev 
      mosquitoes. This suggested that the differences in the transcript profiles among the 
      strains are heritable due to a selection process and are not caused by immediate 
      insecticide exposure. Reversal of temephos resistance was demonstrated and, 
      importantly, there was a positive correlation between a decrease in the resistance 
      ratio and an accompanying decrease in the expression levels of previously over 
      expressed genes. Some of the genes identified here have also been implicated in 
      metabolic resistance in other mosquito species and insecticide resistant populations 
      of Ae. aegypti. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The identification of gene expression 
      signatures associated to insecticide resistance and their suppression could greatly 
      aid the development of improved strategies of vector control.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the quantity and distribution of evidence from randomised 
      controlled trials for the treatment of the major neglected tropical diseases and to 
      identify gaps in the evidence with network analysis. DESIGN: Systematic review and 
      network analysis. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and 
      PubMed from inception to 31 August 2011. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled 
      trials that examined treatment of 16 neglected tropical diseases or complications 
      thereof published in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, or Dutch. 
      RESULTS: We identified 971 eligible randomised trials. Leishmaniasis (184 trials, 
      23,039 participants) and geohelminth infections; 160 trials, 46,887 participants) 
      were the most studied, while dracunculiasis (nine trials, 798 participants) and 
      Buruli ulcer (five trials, 337 participants) were least studied. Relative to its 
      global burden of disease, lymphatic filariasis had the fewest trials and 
      participants. Only 11% of trials were industry funded. Either a single trial or 
      trials with fewer than 100 participants comprised the randomised evidence for first 
      or second line treatments for Buruli ulcer, human African trypanosomiasis, American 
      trypanosomiasis, cysticercosis, rabies, echinococcosis, New World cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis, and each of the foodborne trematode infections. Among the 10 disease 
      categories with more than 40 trials, five lacked sufficient head to head comparisons 
      between first or second line treatments. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable 
      variation in the amount of evidence from randomised controlled trials for each of 
      the 16 major neglected tropical diseases. Even in diseases with substantial 
      evidence, such as leishmaniasis and geohelminth infections, some recommended 
      treatments have limited supporting data and lack head to head comparisons.

      distribution, mechanisms and relations with environmental factors.

AB  - Dengue is an important mosquito borne viral disease in Martinique Island (French 
      West Indies). The viruses responsible for dengue are transmitted by Aedes aegypti, 
      an indoor day-biting mosquito. The most effective proven method for disease 
      prevention has been by vector control by various chemical or biological means. 
      Unfortunately insecticide resistance has already been observed on the Island and 
      recently showed to significantly reduce the efficacy of vector control 
      interventions. In this study, we investigated the distribution of resistance and the 
      underlying mechanisms in nine Ae. aegypti populations. Statistical multifactorial 
      approach was used to investigate the correlations between insecticide resistance 
      levels, associated mechanisms and environmental factors characterizing the mosquito 
      populations. Bioassays revealed high levels of resistance to temephos and 
      deltamethrin and susceptibility to Bti in the 9 populations tested. Biochemical 
      assays showed elevated detoxification enzyme activities of monooxygenases, 
      carboxylesterases and glutathione S-tranferases in most of the populations. 
      Molecular screening for common insecticide target-site mutations, revealed the 
      presence of the "knock-down resistance" V1016I Kdr mutation at high frequency 
      (>87%). Real time quantitative RT-PCR showed the potential involvement of several 
      candidate detoxification genes in insecticide resistance. Principal Component 
      Analysis (PCA) performed with variables characterizing Ae. aegypti from Martinique 
      permitted to underline potential links existing between resistance distribution and 
      other variables such as agriculture practices, vector control interventions and 
      urbanization. Insecticide resistance is widespread but not homogeneously distributed 
      across Martinique. The influence of environmental and operational factors on the 
      evolution of the resistance and mechanisms are discussed.

AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate if the antibodies elicited after 
      immunization with a tetravalent dengue vaccine, based on chimeric yellow fever 
      17D/dengue viruses, can neutralize a large range of dengue viruses (DENV). A panel 
      of 82 DENVs was developed from viruses collected primarily during the last decade in 
      30 countries and included the four serotypes and the majority of existing genotypes. 
      Viruses were isolated and minimally amplified before evaluation against a 
      tetravalent polyclonal serum generated during vaccine preclinical evaluation in 
      monkey, a model in which protection efficacy of this vaccine has been previously 
      demonstrated (Guirakhoo et al., 2004). Neutralization was observed across all the 
      DENV serotypes, genotypes, geographical origins and isolation years. These data 
      indicate that antibodies elicited after immunization with this dengue vaccine 
      candidate should widely protect against infection with contemporary DENV lineages 
      circulating in endemic countries.

TI  - Expression, purification and evaluation of diagnostic potential and immunogenicity 
      of dengue virus type 3 domain III protein.
PG  - 509-19
AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome are the severe manifestations of 
      dengue infection. The quest for reliable dengue diagnostics and a dengue vaccine 
      remained elusive for decades. Domain III of dengue virus envelope contains multiple 
      conformation dependant neutralizing epitopes, thus making it an attractive 
      diagnostic and vaccine candidate. In this report we show the expression of dengue 
      virus type 3 envelope domain III protein (D3EDIII) and demonstrate its potential as 
      a diagnostic and vaccine candidate. Accordingly, D3EDIII was expressed to high 
      levels in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The 
      purified protein was used to develop an in-house plate ELISA and was further tested 
      with a panel of 40 dengue infected serum samples previously characterized by 
      commercially available serological tests. The in-house results were in excellent 
      agreement with the commercial kits. D3EDIII was refolded by rapid dilution method 
      and the refolded monomer protein was purified by Ion exchange chromatography. 
      Further, the recombinant protein was biologically functional and found to inhibit 
      dengue virus type 3 plaque formation on LLC-MK2 cells demonstrating its function of 
      receptor interaction. Furthermore, D3EDIII in combination with Freund's complete 
      adjuvant induced high antibody titers in BALB/c mice and these antibodies 
      efficiently neutralized dengue 3 virus. Additionally, D3EDIII induced expression of 
      Th1 cytokines that can inhibit the intracellular viral infections. Thus, our results 
      demonstrate that D3EDIII protein has tremendous potential both in diagnosis of 
      dengue infections and in vaccine development.

TI  - Hepatic involvement in dengue Fever in children.
PG  - 231-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hepatic dysfunction is common in dengue infection and the degree of liver 
      dysfunction in children varies from mild injury with elevation of transaminases to 
      severe injury with jaundice. This study was undertaken to assess the spectrum of 
      hepatic involvement in dengue infection. METHODS: 110 children with serologically 
      positive dengue fever aged between 2 months - 14 years were studied for their 
      hepatic functions both clinically and biochemically after excluding malaria, enteric 
      fever, Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B with relevant investigations. FINDINGS: All cases 
      were grouped into DF (Dengue fever), DHF (Dengue hemorrhagic fever) and DSS (Dengue 
      shock syndrome) according to WHO criteria. The spectrum of hepatic manifestations 
      included hepatomegaly (79%), hepatic tenderness (56%), jaundice (4.5%), raised 
      levels of aspartate transaminase (AST)(93%), alanine transaminase (ALT)(78%), 
      alkaline phosphatase (AP) (57%), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (20%), reduced 
      levels of serum albumin (66%) and abnormal abdomen ultrasound (65%). CONCLUSION: 
      Hepatic dysfunction was observed more in DHF and DSS group compared to DF group. 
      About 17.27% of children had >10 fold increase in the liver enzymes. There was no 
      correlation between the degree of hepatic enlargement or hepatic tenderness with the 
      abnormalities of liver functions. Any child with fever, jaundice and tender 
      hepatomegaly in geographical areas where dengue is endemic, the diagnosis of dengue 
      infection should be strongly considered.

TI  - Incidence of dengue virus infection among Japanese travellers, 2006 to 2010.
PG  - 39-45
LID - 10.5365/WPSAR.2011.2.3.002 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dengue continues to be a global public health concern. In Japan, 
      although dengue cases are currently seen only among travellers returning from 
      endemic areas, the number of reported cases is rising according to the national 
      case-based surveillance system. We evaluated the characteristics of dengue cases 
      imported into Japan and the relationship between the incidence of infection and 
      season of travel to popular destinations. METHODS: Dengue cases reported to the 
      national surveillance system were retrospectively examined. The number of reported 
      cases per number of Japanese travellers to a dengue-endemic country was calculated 
      to estimate the country-specific incidence of imported dengue virus infection. The 
      incidence of dengue infection among Japanese travellers was compared between dengue 
      high season and low season in each country using relative risk (RR) and associated 
      95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Among 540 Japanese residents who were 
      reported as dengue cases from 2006 to 2010, the majority had travelled to Indonesia, 
      India, the Philippines and Thailand. The RR of dengue infection among Japanese 
      travellers during dengue high season versus low season was 4.92 (95% CI: 3.01-8.04) 
      for the Philippines, 2.76 (95% CI: 1.67-4.54) for Thailand and 0.37 (95% CI: 
      0.15-0.92) for Indonesia. DISCUSSION: Overall, higher incidence of imported cases 
      appeared to be related to historic dengue high seasons. Travellers planning to visit 
      dengue-endemic countries should be aware of historic dengue seasonality and the 
      current dengue situation.

AB  - Dengue virus infection is a serious health problem infecting 2.5 billion people 
      worldwide. Dengue is now endemic in more than 100 countries, including Pakistan. 
      Each year hundreds of people get infected with dengue in Pakistan. Currently, there 
      is no vaccine available for the prevention of Dengue virus infection due to four 
      viral serotypes. Dengue infection can cause death of patients in its most severity, 
      meanwhile many antiviral compounds are being tested against dengue virus infection 
      to eradicate this disease but still there is a need to develop an efficient, 
      low-cost and safe vaccine that can target all the four serotypes of dengue virus. 
      This review summarizes dengue molecular virology, important drug targets, prevalence 
      in Pakistan, diagnosis, treatment and medicinal plant inhibitors against dengue.

AB  - Dramatic increases in dengue (DEN) incidence and disease severity have been 
      reported, in great part due to the geographic expansion of Aedes aegypti and Aedes 
      albopictus mosquitoes. One result is the expanded co-circulation of all dengue 1-4 
      serotype viruses (DENV) in urban areas worldwide, especially in South and South-East 
      Asia, and South America. DEN disease severity ranges from asymptomatic infections to 
      febrile dengue fevers (DF) to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and 
      dengue shock syndrome (DSS). There is an urgent need for a safe and effective 
      tetravalent DEN vaccine. Several live attenuated, tetravalent DEN vaccine candidates 
      have been generated by recombinant DNA technology; these candidates are capable of 
      providing immunity to all four DENV serotypes. In this paper we review (a) 
      recombinant live-attenuated DEN vaccine candidates in terms of deletion, antigen 
      chimerization, and the introduction of adaptive mutations; (b) strategies for 
      improving tetravalent vaccine attenuation; and (c) live-attenuated DENV vaccine 
      development.

LID - 10.4103/0976-9668.95976 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne, arboviral infection found in tropical 
      and sub-tropical climates. Clinical presentation varies from a severe flu-like 
      illness to a potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue has been regarded 
      as a nonneurotropic virus. However, there are reports describing neurological 
      involvements in dengue virus infection. The neurological involvement in dengue virus 
      infection includes encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse 
      myelitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. The neurological spectrum of dengue patients 
      has been limited because of small number of case reports, paucity of imaging, and 
      neurophysiologic studies. There are only a few isolated case reports and case series 
      documenting acute pure motor quadriparesis in dengue fever. We report acute pure 
      motor reversible quadriparesis due to hypokalemia. Clinicians in the endemic area 
      should be aware of such association of acute pure motor reversible quadriparesis 
      with dengue fever.

TI  - Detection of dengue virus 4 from central India.
PG  - 491-4
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Dengue is an important arboviral disease. All four dengue 
      virus serotypes are reported to be circulating in India. It is also known that 
      different serotypes, genotypes and clades of genotype determine outbreak severity. 
      Dengue affected children are known to have serious disease outcome. We carried out 
      this study to give reliable diagnosis of dengue infection in children and to detect 
      circulating serotype in central India. METHODS: Samples collected from paediatric 
      patients suspected to have dengue fever were subjected to IgM and IgG ELISA to 
      determine dengue virus infection. Samples collected within 0-5 days of onset of 
      illness and positive by IgM ELISA were tested by nested reverse transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction (nRT-PCR). The PCR products were sequenced and analyzed. 
      RESULTS: Of the 89 samples tested, 18 and 7 were positive for dengue IgM and IgG, 
      respectively. Dengue activity was observed in both Jabalpur city and adjoining rural 
      settings. One sample found positive by nRT-PCR was further sequenced to confirm 
      dengue virus 4 as aetiological agent. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      demonstrated dengue virus infection in children and adolescent in central India. 
      Because of continuous changing epidemiology, it is important to monitor dengue virus 
      activity at both serological and molecular level in this part of the country for 
      better patient care and management.

TI  - [Screening and identification of dengue virus type 2-specific antigens].
PG  - 1667-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen and identify dengue virus type 2 specific antigens and 
      establish an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting dengue virus 
      type 2 antibody. METHODS: Using the bioinformatic software DNAstar and ANTHEPROT, we 
      analyzed the hydrophilicity, flexibility, surface probability and antigenicity of 
      dengue virus type 1-4, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Yellow fever virus M and E 
      protein amino acid sequences, and also evaluated the influence of secondary 
      structure. The specific epitopes of dengue virus type 2 were predicted according to 
      the epitope location and amino acid sequence similarity, and the epitope 
      conservation was assessed using the sequence information of different dengue virus 
      type 2 strains in GenBank. Based on the results of bioinformatic analysis, 5 
      specific epitopes were amplified and inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector 
      pET32a, which were transferred into E. coli Rosetta (DE3) for expression of the 
      proteins. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were used to identify the expressed proteins 
      and test their antigenicities. The antigen selected by Western blotting was used to 
      establish the ELISA system for dengue virus type 2 antibody detection. RESULTS: 
      Bioinformatic analysis predicted 8 possible dengue virus type 2 specific epitopes, 
      and 6 of them were efficiently expressed in E. coli. Western blotting confirmed 1 
      dengue virus type 2 specific antigen, the ELISA system for dengue virus antibody 
      detection was successfully established using this specific antigen. CONCLUSION: We 
      have obtained a dengue virus type 2 specific antigen and established an ELISA system 
      for detection of dengue virus type 2 antibody.

AB  - The astonishing speed with which Dengue has spread across the world and the severity 
      of its infection make Dengue a prime threat to human life worldwide. Unfortunately, 
      to date there are no effective vaccines or treatments against Dengue. Since only a 
      few assays permit rapid and sensitive detection of Dengue, we developed a specific 
      antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the abundant 
      structural Dengue-2 capsid protein. We showed that the ELISA allows rapid and 
      sensitive detection of Dengue-2 replication in various cell lines including human 
      and mosquito cells. Using anti-capsid antibodies, we demonstrated that the capsid 
      ELISA is as accurate as other well-characterized Dengue assays such as intracellular 
      FACS staining (IFSA) and fluorescent focus (FFA) assays. The capsid ELISA not only 
      represents a useful tool for in vitro basic research, but it may also represent a 
      valuable diagnostic tool for Dengue infection in patients.

AB  - Two formulations of a new live tetravalent dengue virus (DENV) vaccine produced 
      using re-derived master seeds from a precursor vaccine and that same precursor 
      vaccine as a control were compared in a placebo-controlled, randomized, 
      observer-blind, phase II trial of 86 healthy adults. Two vaccine doses were 
      administered 6 months apart; a third dose was offered to a subset. Symptoms and 
      signs of dengue-like illness reported after vaccination were mild to moderate, 
      transient, and occurred with similar frequency among recipients of the new DENV 
      vaccine and placebo, except for rash. Neither dengue nor vaccine-related serious 
      adverse events were reported. The first DENV vaccine dose was moderately 
      immunogenic; the second dose increased the potency and breadth of the neutralizing 
      antibody response. Tetravalent response rates to the new formulations were 60% and 
      66.7% in unprimed subjects. A third dose did not increase tetravalent antibody 
      rates. The new DENV vaccine candidates merit additional evaluation.

AB  - In dengue virus infections the asymptomatic cases are much more frequent than the 
      symptomatic ones, but their true role in the introduction and subsequent spread of 
      dengue viruses in non-endemic regions remains to de clarified. We analyzed data from 
      English and French literatures to assess if viremia in asymptomatic dengue 
      infections might be sufficient to represent a true risk. During outbreaks of dengue 
      a large number of individuals are infected and since viremia levels in symptomatic 
      patients are known to vary by many orders of magnitude, it is reasonable to augur 
      that a proportion of asymptomatic cases might reach levels of viremia sufficient to 
      infect competent mosquitoes. In addition, a number of new ways of contamination in 
      man by dengue viruses were recently described such as blood transfusion, bone marrow 
      transplantation, and nosocomial infections that may be worth considering.

TI  - Seroprevalence and trend of dengue cases admitted to a government hospital, delhi - 
      5-year study (2006-2010): a look into the age shift.
PG  - 537-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of dengue infection is easily and best accomplished by 
      demonstration of specific IgM antibodies in blood. We analyzed retrospectively the 
      dengue IgM seropositivity available for samples obtained over a period of 5 years 
      (2006-2010) from patients with suspected dengue fever (DF)-like illness to 
      investigate whether there was an overall increase in the dengue IgM prevalence over 
      this period. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from patients with DF-like 
      febrile illnesses attending the Pediatric, Medicine, and Fever clinics of a 
      Government hospital, Delhi. A total of 8138 individuals (suspected dengue cases) 
      obtained over 5 years were tested for dengue specific IgM antibodies. Year wise, 
      month wise, and age wise data on geographic distribution and clinical manifestations 
      were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 8138 samples, 1600 (19.66%) were positive for dengue 
      specific IgM. The year 2006 had the highest number of reported cases, 761 (46.23%). 
      In our study, the age group most commonly affected of all 5 years was 11-20 years. 
      Out of the total 1600 cases admitted to the hospital between 2006 and 2010, 279 
      (58.9%) had DF, 178 (37.6%) had dengue hemorrhagic fever, and 16 (3.38%) had dengue 
      shock syndrome. We found a high burden of dengue in young children and late 
      adolescents in both rural and urban communities at a magnitude greater than 
      previously described. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: We observed an increase in the 
      dengue positive cases every alternate year, thereby indicating a possible role of 
      herd immunity in northern India. We did not find a steady increase in the number of 
      cases over 5 years. We found an increase in the number of positive cases in children 
      and young adolescents.

AB  - Dengue viruses cause two severe diseases that alter vascular fluid barrier 
      functions, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The 
      endothelium is the primary fluid barrier of the vasculature and ultimately the 
      effects of dengue virus infection that cause capillary leakage impact endothelial 
      cell (EC) barrier functions. The ability of dengue virus to infect the endothelium 
      provides a direct means for dengue to alter capillary permeability, permit virus 
      replication, and induce responses that recruit immune cells to the endothelium. 
      Recent studies focused on dengue virus infection of primary ECs have demonstrated 
      that ECs are efficiently infected, rapidly produce viral progeny, and elicit immune 
      enhancing cytokine responses that may contribute to pathogenesis. Furthermore, 
      infected ECs have also been implicated in enhancing viremia and immunopathogenesis 
      within murine dengue disease models. Thus dengue-infected ECs have the potential to 
      directly contribute to immune enhancement, capillary permeability, viremia, and 
      immune targeting of the endothelium. These effects implicate responses of the 
      infected endothelium in dengue pathogenesis and rationalize therapeutic targeting of 
      the endothelium and EC responses as a means of reducing the severity of dengue virus 
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is an urban arbovirus whose etiologic agent is a virus of the 
      genus Flavorius with four distinct antigen serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and 
      DENV-4) that is transmitted to humans through the bite of the mosquito Aedes 
      aegypti. The Campo Mourão region in Brazil is endemic for dengue fever. OBTECTIVE: 
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies 
      specific to the four serotypes of dengue in donors of the blood donor service in the 
      city of Campo Mourão. METHODS: Epidemiological records were evaluated and 4 mL of 
      peripheral blood from 213 blood donors were collected in tubes without 
      anticoagulant. Serum was then obtained and immunochromatographic tests were 
      undertaken (Imuno-Rápido Dengue IgM/IgG(TM)). Individuals involved in the study 
      answered a social and epidemiological questionnaire on data which included age, 
      gender and diagnosis of dengue. RESULTS: Only three (1.4%) of the 213 blood tests 
      were positive for IgG anti-dengue antibodies. No donors with IgM antibody, which 
      identifies acute infection, were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current 
      analysis show that the introduction of quantitative or molecular serological methods 
      to determine the presence of anti-dengue antibodies or the detection of the dengue 
      virus in blood donors in endemic regions should be established so that the quality 
      of blood transfusions is guaranteed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delhi, the capital of India, has suffered many outbreaks of dengue in 
      recent past and despite the obvious magnitude of problem, very scarce evidence 
      exists that documents the knowledge, awareness and practices of the people regarding 
      dengue. AIM: To assess the knowledge and practices related to control of dengue 
      fever and to assess the differences in knowledge and practices based on sex and 
      literacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among persons 
      visiting a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi. A systematic sampling procedure was 
      adopted and a pretested questionnaire was used. RESULTS: A total of 215 individuals 
      were interviewed. Majority of the respondents (96.3%) had heard about dengue. The 
      important sources of information were television (54.9%) and newspaper/magazines 
      (51.7%). Around 89% of the study participants considered dengue as "serious 
      problem". Nearly 86% participants were aware of the spread of dengue by mosquitoes 
      while 73% were aware of one of the correct breeding sites of Aedes mosquito. 
      Mosquito mats/liquidators were used by 61% of respondents, coils by 56% and 
      repellant creams by 22%. CONCLUSION: The awareness regarding dengue and mosquito 
      control measures was satisfactory to an extent. Programs should focus that this 
      knowledge gets translated into practice.

AB  - Dengue diseases have an economic as well as social burden worldwide. In this study, 
      the antiviral activity of protegrin-1 (PG-1, RGGRLCYCRRRFCVCVGR) peptide towards 
      dengue NS2B-NS3pro and viral replication in Rhesus monkey kidney (MK2) cells was 
      investigated. The peptide PG-1 was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis, and 
      disulphide bonds formation followed by peptide purification was confirmed by LC-MS 
      and RPHPLC. Dengue NS2B-NS3pro was produced as a single-chain recombinant protein in 
      E. coli. The NS2B-NS3pro assay was carried out by measuring the florescence emission 
      of catalyzed substrate. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the inhibition potential 
      of PG-1 towards dengue serotype-2 (DENV-2) replication in MK2 cells. The results 
      showed that PG-1 inhibited dengue NS2B-NS3pro at IC(50) of 11.7 μM. The graded 
      concentrations of PG-1 at nontoxic range were able to reduce viral replication 
      significantly (P < 0.001) at 24, 48, and 72 hrs after viral infection. However, the 
      percentage of inhibition was significantly (P < 0.01) higher at 24 hrs compared to 
      48 and 72 hrs. These data show promising therapeutic potential of PG-1 against 
      dengue infection, hence it warrants further analysis and improvement of the peptide 
      features as a prospective starting point for consideration in designing attractive 
      dengue virus inhibitors.

AB  - The endemic area for dengue fever extends over 60 countries, and approximately 2.5 
      billion people are at risk of infection. The incidence of dengue has multiplied many 
      times over the last five decades at an alarming rate. In the endemic areas, waves of 
      infection occur in epidemics, with thousands of individuals affected, creating a 
      huge burden on the limited resources of a country's health care system. While the 
      illness passes off as a simple febrile episode in many, a few have a severe illness 
      marked by hypovolemic shock and bleeding. Iatrogenic fluid overload in the 
      management may further complicate the picture. In this severe form dengue can be 
      fatal. Tackling the burden of dengue is impeded by several issues, including a lack 
      of understanding about the exact pathophysiology of the infection, inability to 
      successfully control the vector population, lack of specific therapy against the 
      virus, and the technical difficulties in developing a vaccine. This review provides 
      an overview on the epidemiology, natural history, management strategies, and future 
      directions for research on dengue, including the potential for development of a 
      vaccine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During recent outbreak of dengue fever in Delhi, there has been a 
      significant increase in dengue-associated admission in hospitals. To better 
      understand the pathology of dengue haemorrhagic fever, we conducted autopsies of 
      dengue infections deaths within our hospital. METHOD: This was an autopsy study of 
      dengue-associated deaths at a large tertiary care hospital. RESULTS: From Sep 2009 
      to Dec 2010, a total of 1032 patients with serological evidence of dengue infection 
      were admitted to our hospital. There were twelve deaths and autopsies were conducted 
      in six. Adult respiratory distress syndrome, bleeding diathesis, hypotension, 
      hepatic failure and acute renal failure were the common causes of death despite 
      early hospitalization, intravenous fluid, and blood-product support. CONCLUSION: 
      Dengue is associated with severe disease, and deaths do occur despite current 
      supportive management. Early predictors of disease severity and better clinical 
      interventions are needed.

AB  - AIM: The objective of this study was to correlate laboratory tests during the 
      evolution of dengue fever, comparing frequencies between the different clinical 
      forms in order to use test results to predict the severity of the disease. METHODS: 
      This is an observational, descriptive and retrospective study of 154 patients with 
      clinical and serological diagnoses of dengue fever who, in the period from January 
      to May 2008, were admitted in a tertiary state hospital in the city of Fortaleza 
      that is a referral center for infectious diseases. The patients were allocated to 
      two groups according to age: under 15 years old (n = 66) and 15 years or older (n = 
      88). The tests analyzed were blood count, platelet count, and serum aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations. RESULTS: 
      Thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminases were observed in patients with classic 
      dengue fever. The main laboratory abnormalities found in dengue hemorrhagic fever 
      were thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration and elevated transaminases, similar to 
      severe dengue with the exception of hemoconcentration. Most laboratory abnormalities 
      started on the 3rd day but were more evident on the 5th day with restoration of 
      values by the 11(th) day; this was more prominent in under 15-year-olds and with the 
      more severe clinical forms. CONCLUSION: These results are relevant in assessing the 
      disease because they can be used as markers for more severe forms and can help by 
      enabling the adaptation of the therapeutic conduct to the needs of individual 
      patients.

AB  - The envelope protein of dengue virus is involved in host cell attachment for entry 
      and induction of protective immunity. Current efforts are focused on producing a 
      tetravalent vaccine by mixing four monovalent vaccine components. In this work, we 
      developed a genetic vaccine based on a novel adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector 
      expressing the carboxy-terminal truncated envelope protein (79E) of dengue virus. 
      The expression of the recombinant 79E protein in HEK 293 cells was confirmed by 
      Western blot. Vectors packaged with novel AAV capsids (AAV2/8 or AAV2/rh32.33) were 
      injected into C57BL/6 mice intramuscularly. Dengue virus antigen was produced in the 
      mice and induced long-lasting antibody responses against the dengue virus still 
      detectable 20 weeks after immunization. AAV2/8 vaccine induced higher anti-dengue 
      virus antibody levels than AAV2/rh32.33 vaccine or AAV plasmid. Furthermore, the 
      anti-dengue antibodies could neutralize homogeneous dengue virus. These results 
      demonstrated that the AAV vaccines possessed appropriate immunogenicity and could be 
      used for the development of an effective dengue vaccine.

AB  - Dengue virus is the most significant human viral pathogen spread by the bite of an 
      infected mosquito. With no vaccine or antiviral therapy currently available, disease 
      prevention relies largely on surveillance and mosquito control. Preventing the onset 
      of dengue outbreaks and effective vector management would be considerably enhanced 
      through surveillance of dengue virus prevalence in natural mosquito populations. 
      However, current approaches to the identification of virus in field-caught 
      mosquitoes require relatively slow and labor intensive techniques such as virus 
      isolation or RT-PCR involving specialized facilities and personnel. A rapid and 
      portable method for detecting dengue virus-infected mosquitoes is described. Using a 
      hand held battery operated homogenizer and a dengue diagnostic rapid strip the viral 
      protein NS1 was detected as a marker of dengue virus infection. This method could be 
      performed in less than 30 min in the field, requiring no downstream processing, and 
      is able to detect a single infected mosquito in a pool of at least 50 uninfected 
      mosquitoes. The method described in this study allows rapid, real-time monitoring of 
      dengue virus presence in mosquito populations and could be a useful addition to 
      effective monitoring and vector control responses.

AB  - This study analyzed the association between household-level ecologic and 
      individual-level sociodemographic determinants and dengue transmission in urban 
      areas of Chachoengsao province, Thailand. The ecologic and sociodemographic 
      variables were examined by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. 
      In the ecologic model, dengue risk was related to households situated in the ecotope 
      of residential mixed with commercial and densely populated urban residential areas 
      (RCDENPURA) (aOR = 2.23, P = 0.009), high historical dengue risk area (aOR = 2.06, P 
      < 0.001), and presence of household window screens (aOR = 1.62, P = 0.023). In the 
      sociodemographic model, the dengue risk was related to householders aged >45 years 
      (aOR = 3.24, P = 0.003), secondary and higher educational degrees (aOR = 2.33, P = 
      0.013), household members >4 persons (aOR = 2.01, P = 0.02), and community effort in 
      environmental management by clean-up campaign (aOR = 1.91, P = 0.035). It is 
      possible that the preventive measures were positively correlated with dengue risk 
      because these activities were generally carried out in particular households or 
      communities following dengue experiences or dengue outbreaks. Interestingly, the 
      ecotope of RCDENPURA and high historical dengue risk area appeared to be very good 
      predictors of dengue incidences.

AB  - Dengue is the most important disease caused by an arbovirus worldwide. Its clinical 
      manifestations are very large from asymptomatic infections to severe diseases with 
      fatal outcome. No effective antiviral treatment or vaccine is available. Thus, a 
      rapid and accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance both for better clinical 
      case management and surveillance. Diagnosis methods depend on the time clinical 
      signs appeared. Within the 7 first days of fever, direct tests are preferred. RT-PCR 
      methods are sensitive, specific, and can identify viral serotypes. Conventional 
      RT-PCR will probably be replaced by real time PCR as soon as standardised and 
      accurate assays for the four serotypes will be available. Serology (EIA) is used 
      only after 7 days of disease, i.e. late in the course of dengue; it is accurate, 
      specific but not discriminatory for serotypes and high cross-reactive. NS1 antigen 
      detection still lack of clinical sensitivity and viral isolation is too fastidious. 
      Even though ameliorations are necessary, viral detection by RT-PCR remains the best 
      tool in clinical settings for a rapid diagnosis of severe dengue infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Currently, dengue represents one of the most significant arboviral 
      disease worldwide, for which a vaccine is not yet available. Persistent challenges 
      in live viral dengue vaccines have sparked a keen interest in exploring 
      non-replicating dengue vaccines. We have examined the feasibility of using the 
      methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris to develop a chimeric vaccine candidate 
      displaying the dengue virus type-2 (DENV-2) envelope domain III (EDIII), implicated 
      in host receptor binding and in the induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies, on 
      the surface of non-infectious virus-like particles (VLP)-based on the Hepatitis B 
      virus core antigen (HBcAg). METHODS: We designed a fusion antigen by inserting 
      DENV-2 EDIII into c/e1 loop of HBcAg. A codon-optimized gene encoding this fusion 
      antigen was integrated into the genome of P. pastoris, under the control of the 
      Alcohol Oxidase 1 promoter. The antigen was expressed by methanol induction and 
      purified to near homogeneity by Ni(2+) affinity chromatography. The purified antigen 
      was characterized physically and functionally to evaluate its ability to assemble 
      into VLPs, and elicit DENV-2-specific antibodies in mice. RESULTS: This fusion 
      antigen was expressed successfully to high yields and purified to near homogeneity. 
      Electron microscopy and competitive ELISA analyses showed that it formed VLPs in 
      which the EDIII moiety was accessible to different EDIII-specific antibodies. These 
      VLPs were immunogenic in mice, stimulating the production of antibodies that could 
      specifically recognize DENV-2 and neutralize its infectivity. However, 
      virus-neutralizing antibody titers were modest. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show: (i) 
      insertion of EDIII into the c/e1 loop of HBcAg does not compromise particle 
      assembly; and (ii) the chimeric VLPs elicit a specific humoral response against 
      DENV-2. The strategy of displaying dengue virus EDIII using a VLP platform will need 
      further optimization before it may be developed into a viable alternative option.

AB  - In view of the rising prevalence of dengue virus and mixing of host and vector 
      populations, complete full-length sequence determination of dengue strains isolated 
      from different epidemic areas is important for the study of virus evolution, 
      pathogenicity, vaccine efficiency and diagnosis. Based on the genomic analysis of 51 
      complete dengue virus sequences, all of which cocirculated in Thailand between 1974 
      and 2001, we report here the occurrence of homologous recombination in the NS5 
      nonstructural gene region of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) strains. In order to 
      analyze those 51 virus sequences at one time, we chose to use a highly sensitive 
      recombination detection program called RDP. When RDP detects a possible 
      recombination event, further bootscanning and phylogenetic tree analyses are applied 
      to these candidate sequences to identify this recombination event. We found that 
      within the DENV-2 subfamily, the strain ThNH63/93 is the evolutionary product of a 
      recombination event between ThNH62/93 and ThD2_0284_90 strains. The strain ThNH62/93 
      was identified as the major parent, while the strain ThD2_0284_90 was the minor 
      parent. The recombination site was determined to localize between positions 7967 (± 
      36 nt) and 8283 (± 36 nt) with a significance level of p < 0.001. Our results 
      showed, for the first time, that an intraserotype recombination event occurred 
      between DENV-2 strains in the nonstructural gene region; by contrast, an 
      interserotype recombination between different serotypes of dengue strains was not 
      identified. This study thus supports the theory that homologous recombination plays 
      a key role in dengue virus evolution.

AB  - The major weaknesses of subunit vaccines are their low immunogenicity and poor 
      efficacy. Adjuvants can help to overcome some of these inherent defects with subunit 
      vaccines. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of the newly developed 
      water-in-oil-in-water multiphase emulsion system, termed PELC, in potentiating the 
      protective capacity of dengue-1 envelope protein domain III. Unlike aluminum 
      phosphate, dengue-1 envelope protein domain III formulated with PELC plus CpG 
      oligodeoxynucleotides induced neutralizing antibodies against dengue-1 virus and 
      increased the splenocyte secretion of IFN-γ after in vitro re-stimulation. The 
      induced antibodies contained both the IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses. A rapid anamnestic 
      neutralizing antibody response against a live dengue virus challenge was elicited at 
      week 26 after the first immunization. These results demonstrate that PELC plus CpG 
      oligodeoxynucleotides broaden the dengue-1 envelope protein domain III-specific 
      immune responses. PELC plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides is a promising adjuvant for 
      recombinant protein based vaccination against dengue virus.

AB  - Dengue infection is a leading cause of illness and death in tropical and subtropical 
      regions of the world. Forty percent of the world's population currently lives in 
      these areas. The clinical picture resulting from dengue infection can range from 
      relatively minor to catastrophic hemorrhagic fever. Recently, reports have increased 
      of neurological manifestations. Neuropathogenesis seems to be related to direct 
      nervous system viral invasion, autoimmune reaction, metabolic and hemorrhagic 
      disturbance. Neurological manifestations include encephalitis, encephalopathy, 
      meningitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, 
      polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy, and cerebromeningeal hemorrhage. The development of 
      neurological symptoms in patients with positive Immunoglobulin M (IgM) dengue 
      serology suggests a means of diagnosing the neurological complications associated 
      with dengue. Viral antigens, specific IgM antibodies, and the intrathecal synthesis 
      of dengue antibodies have been successfully detected in cerebrospinal fluid. 
      However, despite diagnostic advancements, the treatment of neurological dengue is 
      problematic. The launch of a dengue vaccine is expected to be beneficial.

TI  - Induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses by dengue virus type 
      1 virus-like particles prepared from Pichia pastoris.
PG  - 1986-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is currently a significant global health problem but no vaccines 
      are available against the four dengue serotypes virus infections. The development of 
      safe and effective vaccines has been hampered by the requirement of conferring 
      complete protection against all four dengue serotypes and the lack of a convenient 
      animal model. Virus-like particles (VLPs) have emerged as a promising subunit 
      vaccine candidate. One strategy of vaccine development is to produce a tetravalent 
      dengue subunit vaccine by mixing recombinant VLPs, corresponding to all four dengue 
      virus serotypes. Towards this end, this study aimed to establish a Pichia pastoris 
      (P. pastoris) expression system for production of dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) VLPs 
      and evaluate the humoral and cellular immune response of this particle in mice. 
      METHODS: A recombinant yeast P. pastoris clone containing prM and E genes of DENV-1 
      was constructed and DENV-1 VLPs expressed by this clone were analyzed by sucrose 
      density gradient centrifugation, Western blotting, and transmission electron 
      microscope. Groups of mice were immunized by these particles plus adjuvant 
      formulations, then mice were tested by ELISA and neutralization assay for humoral 
      immune response, and by lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production assays for 
      a cellular immune response. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that recombinant DENV-1 
      VLPs consisting of prM and E protein were successfully expressed in the yeast P. 
      pastoris. Sera of VLPs immunized mice were shown to contain a high-titer of 
      antibodies and the neutralization assay suggested that those antibodies neutralized 
      virus infection in vitro. Data from the T lymphocyte proliferation assay showed 
      proliferation of T cell, and ELISA found elevated secretion levels of interferon 
      IFN-γ and IL-4. CONCLUSIONS: P. pastoris-expressed DENV-1 VLPs can induce virus 
      neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses in immunized mice. Using P. pastoris to 
      produce VLPs offers a promising and economic strategy for dengue virus vaccine 
      development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the burden of dengue disease in Colombia and its associated 
      costs. METHODS: We estimated the burden of dengue and severe dengue in Colombia for 
      the period 2011 to 2014 on the basis of a dynamic model calibrated against Colombian 
      surveillance data. The model estimated the annual number of dengue and severe dengue 
      cases for those receiving medical care and those who do not. We calculated the 
      average cost of care per patient on the basis of a bottom-up costing of cases, and 
      additional costs were estimated for activities of vector control and other community 
      interventions. Economic information from a sample of local and departmental vector 
      control programs was reviewed. RESULTS: The dynamic model estimated that for 2011 
      and 2012 there would be 56,998 dengue cases requiring medical attention (22,799 
      ambulatory and 34,199 hospitalized), 1851 cases of severe dengue, and 205 deaths. 
      The economic analysis, with 2011 data, showed that Colombia would spend between US 
      $52.2 and US $61.0 million for dengue control activities and case management in an 
      average year. Medical management costs would amount to US $16.9 million (CI 95% 
      15.2-18.5 million), while vector control activities and other community 
      interventions would cost between US $37.08 and US $42.41 million. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Dengue infection has an important impact on the health care system budget in 
      Colombia. Most of the economic impact corresponds to community activities directed 
      to prevent vector infestation (68.7%-71.0%), which are expensive and whose 
      effectiveness is controversial.

TI  - Expression and immunoaffinity purification of recombinant dengue virus 2 NS1 protein 
      as a cleavable SUMOstar fusion.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) encoded nonstructural one (NS1) is a 352 amino acid protein that 
      exists in multiple oligomeric states and is conserved within the flavivirus family. 
      Although NS1 has been heavily researched for its diagnostic utility, there is a gap 
      in the understanding of its role in a range of viral processes, including 
      replication and development of clinical pathologies such as vascular leakage. Many 
      of these functions involve unknown interactions with viral and host proteins. This 
      study describes the generation of a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb 56.2) that reacts 
      with NS1 from DENV1 and 2, and the expression of recombinant SUMOstar-tagged DENV2 
      NS1 (DENV2 S∗-NS1) in baculovirus. This is the first time dengue NS1 has been 
      produced as a SUMOstar fusion with the S∗-tag increasing protein solubility and 
      secretion compared with a non-S∗-tagged NS1 construct. The protein was readily 
      purified using a mAb 56.2 immunoaffinity column and untagged NS1 was obtained by 
      treatment with tobacco etch virus protease to remove the S∗-tag. Size exclusion 
      chromatography and glycosylation assays showed that both secreted S∗-NS1, and 
      cleaved NS1, are hexameric and glycosylated, and will be useful tools in elucidating 
      dengue NS1 protein interactions and functions.

AB  - Dengue virus infections are still increasing at an alarming rate in tropical and 
      subtropical countries, underlying the need for a dengue vaccine. Although it is 
      relatively easy to generate Ab responses to dengue virus, low avidity or low 
      concentrations of Ab may enhance infection of FcR-bearing cells with clinical 
      impact, posing a challenge to vaccine production. In this article, we report the 
      characterization of a mAb, 2H12, which is cross-reactive to all four serotypes in 
      the dengue virus group. Crystal structures of 2H12-Fab in complex with domain III of 
      the envelope protein from three dengue serotypes have been determined. 2H12 binds to 
      the highly conserved AB loop of domain III of the envelope protein that is poorly 
      accessible in the mature virion. 2H12 neutralization varied between dengue serotypes 
      and strains; in particular, dengue serotype 2 was not neutralized. Because the 
      2H12-binding epitope was conserved, this variation in neutralization highlights 
      differences between dengue serotypes and suggests that significant conformational 
      changes in the virus must take place for Ab binding. Surprisingly, 2H12 facilitated 
      little or no enhancement of infection. These data provide a structural basis for 
      understanding Ab neutralization and enhancement of infection, which is crucial for 
      the development of future dengue vaccines.

AB  - Dengue virus infection causes significant morbidity and mortality in humans 
      world-wide. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the major vector that spreads dengue virus 
      to humans. Interaction between dengue viruses and A. aegypti is a multi-factorial 
      phenomena that is determined by both virus and mosquito genotypes. Although, studies 
      have suggested significant association of mosquito vectorial capacity with 
      population variation of dengue virus, specifications of the vector factors that may 
      influence vector-virus compatibility are very limited in the literature. Recently, 
      we have shown that a large number of genes are differentially expressed between 
      MOYO-S (susceptible) and MOYO-R (refractory) A. aegypti strains upon infection with 
      dengue virus (JAM-1409 genotype). In the current study, we show that specific 
      intrinsic features of A. aegypti genes are significantly associated with 
      'responsiveness' of mosquito genes to dengue infection. Binomial logistic regression 
      analysis further reveals differential marginal effects of these features on gene 
      responsiveness of mosquitoes to the viral infection. Thus, our result shows that 
      intrinsic features of genes significantly affect differential expression of A. 
      aegypti genes to dengue infection. The information will benefit further 
      investigations on evolution of genes among natural populations of A. aegypti 
      conferring differential susceptibility to dengue virus.

AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) cause a spectrum of disease in humans, ranging from dengue 
      fever (DF) to a severe, life-threatening syndrome called dengue hemorrhagic 
      fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Despite the global morbidity and mortality 
      associated with DENV infection, mechanisms of immune control and viral pathogenesis 
      are poorly understood. In a recent article, Avirutnan et al. [mBio 2(6):e00276-11, 
      2011] demonstrated that DENV can be directly neutralized via the mannose binding 
      lectin (MBL) pathway of the complement system and that deficiency in MBL level or 
      activity due to host polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene correlates with reduced levels 
      of DENV neutralization. These findings implicate a role for the MBL pathway in 
      controlling DENV infections and modulating DHF/DSS manifestations.

PG  - 408-14
LID - 10.1007/s11262-011-0709-2 [doi]
AB  - The existence of four dengue serotypes is associated with a phenomenon called 
      "Antibody-Dependent Enhancement" that has been suggested to cause a severe form of 
      dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. To study the evolutionary event that 
      drove the serotype separation, we employed the maximum likelihood approach by 
      focusing on the Premembrane (prM) and Envelop (E) genes. We showed that the 
      separation of dengue serotypes had been dominantly under purifying selection. In 
      spite of the strong selective constraint, one codon of prM gene and twelve codons of 
      E gene were detected to be under positive selection. This indicates that the E 
      protein might have been under a stronger positive pressure than the PrM protein. The 
      codons under positive selection were identified along the interserotypic branches, 
      suggesting that changes at these sites were probably associated with the emergence 
      of the four serotypes and/or adaptation to the new transmission environments.

AB  - Dengue fever is the most important arbovirus infection found in tropical regions 
      around the world. Dispersal of the vector and an increase in migratory flow between 
      countries have led to large epidemics and severe clinical outcomes, such as dengue 
      haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. This study analysed the genetic 
      variability of the dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) in Brazil with regard to the 
      full-length structural genes C/prM/M/E among 34 strains isolated during epidemics 
      that occurred in the country between 1994-2011. Virus phylogeny and time of 
      divergence were also evaluated with only the E gene of the strains isolated from 
      1994-2008. An analysis of amino acid differences between these strains and the 
      French Guiana strain (FGA/89) revealed the presence of important nonsynonymous 
      substitutions in the amino acid sequences, including residues E297 (Met→Thr) and 
      E338 (Ser→Leu). A phylogenetic analysis of E proteins comparing the studied isolates 
      and other strains selected from the GenBank database showed that the Brazilian 
      DENV-1 strains since 1982 belonged to genotype V. This analysis also showed that 
      different introductions of strains from the 1990s represented lineage replacement, 
      with the identification of three lineages that cluster all isolates from the 
      Americas. An analysis of the divergence time of DENV-1 indicated that the lineage 
      circulating in Brazil emerged from an ancestral lineage that originated 
      approximately 44.35 years ago.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is the most important arthropod born viral disease of 
      public health significance. Although most patients suffer only from flu-like 
      symptoms, a small group of patient experiences more severe forms of the disease. To 
      contribute to a better understanding of its pathogenesis this study aims to identify 
      proteins differentially expressed in a pool of five viremic plasma from severe 
      dengue patients relative to a pool of five non-severe dengue patients. RESULTS: The 
      use of Isotope Coded Protein Labeling (ICPLTM) to analyze plasma depleted of twenty 
      high-abundance proteins allowed for the identification of 51 differentially 
      expressed proteins, which were characterized by mass spectrometry. Using 
      quantitative ELISA, three of these proteins (Leucine-rich glycoprotein 1, Vitamin D 
      binding-protein and Ferritin) were confirmed as having an increased expression in a 
      panel of severe dengue plasma. The proteins identified as overexpressed by ICPLTM in 
      severe dengue plasma involve in clear up action after cell injury, tissue coherence 
      and immune defense. CONCLUSION: This ICPLTM study evaluating differences between 
      acute severe dengue plasmas and acute non-severe dengue plasmas suggests that the 
      three proteins identified are overexpressed early in the course of the disease. 
      Their possible use as biomarkers for the prognostic of disease severity is 
      discussed.

AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) are the most important mosquito transmitted viral pathogens 
      infecting humans. DENV infection produces a spectrum of disease, most commonly 
      causing a self-limiting flu-like illness known as dengue fever; yet with increased 
      frequency, manifesting as life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Waning 
      cross-protective immunity from any of the four dengue serotypes may enhance 
      subsequent infection with another heterologous serotype to increase the probability 
      of DHF. Decades of effort to develop dengue vaccines are reaching the finishing line 
      with multiple candidates in clinical trials. Nevertheless, concerns remain that 
      imbalanced immunity, due to the prolonged prime-boost schedules currently used in 
      clinical trials, could leave some vaccinees temporarily unprotected or with 
      increased susceptibility to enhanced disease. Here we develop a DENV serotype 1 
      (DENV-1) DNA vaccine with the immunodominant cross-reactive B cell epitopes 
      associated with immune enhancement removed. We compare wild-type (WT) with this 
      cross-reactivity reduced (CRR) vaccine and demonstrate that both vaccines are 
      equally protective against lethal homologous DENV-1 challenge. Under conditions 
      mimicking natural exposure prior to acquiring protective immunity, WT vaccinated 
      mice enhanced a normally sub-lethal heterologous DENV-2 infection resulting in 
      DHF-like disease and 95% mortality in AG129 mice. However, CRR vaccinated mice 
      exhibited redirected serotype-specific and protective immunity, and significantly 
      reduced morbidity and mortality not differing from naїve mice. Thus, we demonstrate 
      in an in vivo DENV disease model, that non-protective vaccine-induced immunity can 
      prime vaccinees for enhanced DHF-like disease and that CRR DNA immunization 
      significantly reduces this potential vaccine safety concern. The sculpting of immune 
      memory by the modified vaccine and resulting redirection of humoral immunity provide 
      insight into DENV vaccine-induced immune responses.

AB  - Dengue is the major arthropod-borne human viral disease, for which no vaccine or 
      specific treatment is available. We used NMR, zeta potential measurements and atomic 
      force microscopy to study the structural features of the interaction between dengue 
      virus C (capsid) protein and LDs (lipid droplets), organelles crucial for infectious 
      particle formation. C protein-binding sites to LD were mapped, revealing a new 
      function for a conserved segment in the N-terminal disordered region and indicating 
      that conformational selection is involved in recognition. The results suggest that 
      the positively charged N-terminal region of C protein prompts the interaction with 
      negatively charged LDs, after which a conformational rearrangement enables the 
      access of the central hydrophobic patch to the LD surface. Taken together, the 
      results allowed the design of a peptide with inhibitory activity of C protein-LD 
      binding, paving the way for new drug development approaches against dengue.

TI  - A tetravalent dengue nanoparticle stimulates antibody production in mice.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/1477-3155-10-13 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a major public health problem worldwide, especially in the 
      tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Infection with a single Dengue virus 
      (DENV) serotype causes a mild, self-limiting febrile illness called dengue fever. 
      However, a subset of patients experiencing secondary infection with a different 
      serotype progresses to the severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic 
      fever/dengue shock syndrome. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or antiviral 
      drugs to prevent or treat dengue infections. Biodegradable nanoparticles coated with 
      proteins represent a promising method for in vivo delivery of vaccines. FINDINGS: 
      Here, we used a murine model to evaluate the IgG production after administration of 
      inactivated DENV corresponding to all four serotypes adsorbed to bovine serum 
      albumin nanoparticles. This formulation induced a production of anti-DENV IgG 
      antibodies (p < 0.001). However, plaque reduction neutralization assays with the 
      four DENV serotypes revealed that these antibodies have no neutralizing activity in 
      the dilutions tested. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that while the nanoparticle 
      system induces humoral responses against DENV, further investigation with different 
      DENV antigens will be required to improve immunogenicity, epitope specicity, and 
      functional activity to make this platform a viable option for DENV vaccines.

TI  - Wolbachia induces density-dependent inhibition to dengue virus in mosquito cells.
PG  - e1754
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001754 [doi]
LID - e1754
AB  - Wolbachia is a maternal transmitted endosymbiotic bacterium that is estimated to 
      infect up to 65% of insect species. The ability of Wolbachia to both induce viral 
      interference and spread into mosquito vector population makes it possible to develop 
      Wolbachia as a biological control agent for dengue control. While Wolbachia induces 
      resistance to dengue virus in the transinfected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, a similar 
      effect was not observed in Aedes albopictus, which naturally carries Wolbachia 
      infection but still serves as a dengue vector. In order to understand the mechanism 
      of this lack of Wolbachia-mediated viral interference, we used both Ae. albopictus 
      cell line (Aa23) and mosquitoes to characterize the impact of Wolbachia on dengue 
      infection. A serial of sub-lethal doses of antibiotic treatment was used to 
      partially remove Wolbachia in Aa23 cells and generate cell cultures with Wolbachia 
      at different densities. We show that there is a strong negative linear correlation 
      between the genome copy of Wolbachia and dengue virus with a dengue infection 
      completely removed when Wolbacha density reaches a certain level. We then compared 
      Wolbachia density between transinfected Ae. aegypti and naturally infected Ae. 
      albopictus. The results show that Wolbachia density in midgut, fatbody and salivary 
      gland of Ae. albopictus is 80-, 18-, and 24-fold less than that of Ae. aegypti, 
      respectively. We provide evidence that Wolbachia density in somatic tissues of Ae. 
      albopictus is too low to induce resistance to dengue virus. Our results will aid in 
      understanding the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated pathogen interference and 
      developing novel methods to block disease transmission by mosquitoes carrying native 
      Wolbachia infections.

AB  - The number of travel-acquired dengue infections has been on a constant rise in the 
      United States and Europe over the past decade. An increased volume of international 
      passenger air traffic originating from regions with endemic dengue contributes to 
      the increasing number of dengue cases. This paper reports results from a 
      network-based regression model which uses international passenger travel volumes, 
      travel distances, predictive species distribution models (for the vector species), 
      and infection data to quantify the relative risk of importing travel-acquired dengue 
      infections into the US and Europe from dengue-endemic regions. Given the necessary 
      data, this model can be used to identify optimal locations (origin cities, 
      destination airports, etc.) for dengue surveillance. The model can be extended to 
      other geographical regions and vector-borne diseases, as well as other network-based 
      processes.

      dengue viral genome.
PG  - S7
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-13-S7-S7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the world's most common mosquito-borne viral disease. Poor 
      proofreading by RNA polymerase during its replication results in the accumulation of 
      mutations in its genome. This leads to a diversity of genotypes in the viral 
      population termed quasispecies. Quasispecies play an important role in disease 
      severity. The study of quasispecies in dengue has been hindered because of the 
      requirement for large amounts of cloning and sequencing, which could be overcome by 
      454 pyrosequencing. In this study, we attempted to demonstrate the feasibility of 
      using 454 pyrosequencing to study genome diversity of dengue virus quasispecies by 
      sequencing a pool of known dengue viral strains. RESULTS: Two sets of dengue DNA 
      templates were sequenced by 454/Roche GS FLX. The total number of reads for data 1 
      and data 2 were 54,440 and 134,441, with average lengths of 221 and 232 bp, 
      respectively. Reads containing ambiguous base Ns were excluded (6.00% in data 1, 
      7.05% in data 2). More than 99% of reads could be aligned back to the correct 
      serotypes by BLAST. The reads covered the whole genome without any gaps, and the 
      minimum coverage depth was 50×. Frequencies of known strains detected from each data 
      set were highly correlated with the input ratios. We also explored criteria for 
      filtering error reads and artifacts from true variations. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      showed that 454 pyrosequencing, coupled with our analysis procedure, could sequence 
      the whole genome of dengue virus with good coverage. The ratio of detected variants 
      in the sequencing data reflected the starting ratio, proving that the proposed 
      technique could be used to study the frequencies of variants in quasispecies.

AB  - Dengue virus causes ∼50-100 million infections per year and thus is considered one 
      of the most aggressive arthropod-borne human pathogen worldwide. During its 
      replication, dengue virus induces dramatic alterations in the intracellular 
      membranes of infected cells. This phenomenon is observed both in human and 
      vector-derived cells. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry of mosquito cells, we 
      show that this membrane remodeling is directly linked to a unique lipid repertoire 
      induced by dengue virus infection. Specifically, 15% of the metabolites detected 
      were significantly different between DENV infected and uninfected cells while 85% of 
      the metabolites detected were significantly different in isolated replication 
      complex membranes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intracellular lipid 
      redistribution induced by the inhibition of fatty acid synthase, the rate-limiting 
      enzyme in lipid biosynthesis, is sufficient for cell survival but is inhibitory to 
      dengue virus replication. Lipids that have the capacity to destabilize and change 
      the curvature of membranes as well as lipids that change the permeability of 
      membranes are enriched in dengue virus infected cells. Several sphingolipids and 
      other bioactive signaling molecules that are involved in controlling membrane 
      fusion, fission, and trafficking as well as molecules that influence cytoskeletal 
      reorganization are also up regulated during dengue infection. These observations 
      shed light on the emerging role of lipids in shaping the membrane and protein 
      environments during viral infections and suggest membrane-organizing principles that 
      may influence virus-induced intracellular membrane architecture.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) represent a global 
      challenge in public health. It is estimated that 50 to 100 million infections occur 
      each year causing approximately 20,000 deaths that are usually linked to severe 
      cases like DHF and dengue shock syndrome. The causative agent of DF is dengue virus 
      (genus Flavivirus) that comprises four distinct serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4). 
      Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been used successfully to detect 
      pathogenic agents, but has not been implemented in detecting DENV. To improve our 
      understanding of DENV infection and dissemination in host tissues, we designed 
      specific probes to detect DENV in FISH assays. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes were 
      designed to hybridize with RNA from the broadest range of DENV isolates belonging to 
      the four serotypes, but not to the closest Flavivirus genomes. Three probes that fit 
      the criteria defined for FISH experiments were selected, targeting both coding and 
      non-coding regions of the DENV genome. These probes were tested in FISH assays 
      against the dengue vector Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae). The FISH 
      experiments were led in vitro using the C6/36 cell line, and in vivo against 
      dissected salivary glands, with epifluorescence and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: 
      The three 60-nt oligonucleotides probes DENV-Probe A, B and C cover a broad range of 
      DENV isolates from the four serotypes. When the three probes were used together, 
      specific fluorescent signals were observed in C6/36 infected with each DENV 
      serotypes. No signal was detected in either cells infected with close Flavivirus 
      members West Nile virus or yellow fever virus. The same protocol was used on 
      salivary glands of Ae. albopictus fed with a DENV-2 infectious blood-meal which 
      showed positive signals in the lateral lobes of infected samples, with no 
      significant signal in uninfected mosquitoes. CONCLUSION: Based on the FISH 
      technique, we propose a way to design and use oligonucleotide probes to detect 
      arboviruses. Results showed that this method was successfully implemented to 
      specifically detect DENV in a mosquito cell line, as well as in mosquito salivary 
      glands for the DENV-2 serotype. In addition, we emphasize that FISH could be an 
      alternative method to detect arboviruses in host tissues, also offering to 
      circumvent the discontinuity of antibodies used in immunofluorescent assays.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The precise identification of the genetic variants of the dengue virus 
      is important to understand its dispersion and virulence patterns and to identify the 
      strains responsible for epidemic outbreaks. This study investigated the genetic 
      variants of the capsid-premembrane junction region fragment in the dengue virus 
      serotypes 1 and 2 (DENV1-2). METHODS: Samples from 11 municipalities in the State of 
      Paraná, Brazil, were provided by the Central Laboratory of Paraná. They were 
      isolated from the cell culture line C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) and were positive for 
      indirect immunofluorescence. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) extracted from these samples was 
      submitted to the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested 
      PCR. RESULTS: RT-PCR revealed that 4 of the samples were co-infected with both 
      serotypes. The isolated DENV-1 sequences were 95-100% similar to the sequences of 
      other serotype 1 strains deposited in GenBank. Similarly, the isolated DENV-2 
      sequences were 98-100% similar to other serotype 2 sequences in GenBank. According 
      to our neighbor-joining tree, all strains obtained in this study belonged to 
      genotype V of DENV-1. The DENV-2 strains, by contrast, belonged to the 
      American/Asian genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The monitoring of circulating strains is an 
      important tool to detect the migration of virus subtypes involved in dengue 
      epidemics.

AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral hemorrhagic disease that is a major threat to human 
      health in tropical and subtropical regions. Here we report crystal structures of a 
      peptide covalently bound to dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) protease as well as the 
      serine-protease inhibitor aprotinin bound to the same enzyme. These structures 
      reveal, for the first time, a catalytically active, closed conformation of the DENV 
      protease. In the presence of the peptide, the DENV-3 protease forms the closed 
      conformation in which the hydrophilic β-hairpin region of NS2B wraps around the NS3 
      protease core, in a manner analogous to the structure of West Nile virus (WNV) 
      protease. Our results confirm that flavivirus proteases form the closed conformation 
      during proteolysis, as previously proposed for WNV. The current DENV-3 protease 
      structures reveal the detailed interactions at the P4' to P3 sites of the substrate. 
      The new structural information explains the sequence preference, particularly for 
      long basic residues in the nonprime side, as well as the difference in substrate 
      specificity between the WNV and DENV proteases at the prime side. Structural 
      analysis of the DENV-3 protease-peptide complex revealed a pocket that is formed by 
      residues from NS2B and NS3; this pocket also exists in the WNV NS2B/NS3 protease 
      structure and could be targeted for potential antivirus development. The structural 
      information presented in the current study is invaluable for the design of specific 
      inhibitors of DENV protease.

AB  - Both Chikungunya and Dengue virus belong to the acute arthropod-borne viruses. 
      Because of the lack of specific symptoms, it is difficult to distinguish the two 
      infections based on clinical manifestations. To identify and quantitatively detect 
      Chikungunya and Dengue viruses, a real-time accelerated 
      reverse-transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) platform was 
      developed, and 26-confirmed RNA samples, 42 suspects, and 18 healthy serum samples 
      were evaluated by the method. The RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cDNA 
      sequencing were used as references. The results showed that it could identify the 
      Chikungunya and Dengue virus RNA correctly in all antibody-positive samples within 1 
      hour, without any cross-reactions. The virus load of the positive samples was 
      quantitatively detected with a turbidimeter. The sensitivity was 100% and 
      specificity was 95.25%. The findings indicate that the RT-LAMP is an effective 
      method for rapid quantity detection of Chikungunya virus and Dengue virus in serum 
      samples with convenient operation, high specificity, and high sensitivity.

AB  - Dengue is one of the major public health threats in Kolkata. Every year, blood 
      samples with dengue-like illness are referred to us from different medical colleges 
      and hospitals in Kolkata for the detection of dengue infection in them. In 2010, a 
      total of 378 samples were referred to us for that purpose. All the samples were 
      tested for the detection of IgM antibodies by ELISA method, followed by RT-PCR test 
      for the detection of serotypes. Only 173 samples were ELISA positive. Out of 378 
      samples, 108 were RT-PCR positive. Out of 108 samples, 74 samples had monotypic 
      infection with different serotypes of DENV and 33 samples had dual infections with 
      DENV-2 and DENV-3. Only one sample had the infection with DENV-1, DENV-2, and 
      DENV-3. DHF was found mainly among the patients, infected with multiple dengue 
      serotypes. Only 3 dengue monotypic infected patients had suffered from DHF.

AB  - Virus detection and taxonomic identification of serotypes, strains, or genotypes 
      provide important information relevant for diagnosis, and for the epidemiological 
      characterization and tracking of new strains in an endemic region. In the specific 
      case of dengue virus, rapid serotype identification can also be useful in the 
      treatment of secondary infections that may cause the more severe dengue hemorrhagic 
      fever and dengue shock syndrome. In this work, dengue virus was used as a model to 
      test a new approach of combining broadly sensitive RT-PCR amplification of nearly 
      any virus strain with subsequent serotype- and finer-level identification by mass 
      spectrometry. PCR primers were appended with promoter sequences, such that the 
      resulting PCR products could be transcribed into RNA. RNA fragments generated by 
      guanosine-specific RNase T(1) digestion were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser 
      desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Viral serotypes were 
      identified by comparing the pattern of observed fragment masses to a mass database. 
      The database was created by computationally fragmenting 2517 dengue strains after 
      each guanosine residue using the same primers. Computationally, all 2517 strains in 
      the mass database were correctly identified at the serotype level from the predicted 
      PCR product. The methodology was successfully demonstrated experimentally by 
      identifying the serotypes of eight test strains using mosquito cell cultures 
      infected with strains of all four serotypes and with full-length cDNA clones.

AB  - Human blood monocytes play a central role in dengue infections and form the majority 
      of virus infected cells in the blood. Human blood monocytes are heterogeneous and 
      divided into CD16(-) and CD16(+) subsets. Monocyte subsets play distinct roles 
      during disease, but it is not currently known if monocyte subsets differentially 
      contribute to dengue protection and pathogenesis. Here, we compared the 
      susceptibility and response of the human CD16(-) and CD16(+) blood monocyte subsets 
      to primary dengue virus in vitro. We found that both monocyte subsets were equally 
      susceptible to dengue virus (DENV2 NGC), and capable of supporting the initial 
      production of new infective virus particles. Both monocyte subsets produced 
      anti-viral factors, including IFN-α, CXCL10 and TRAIL. However, CD16(+) monocytes 
      were the major producers of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to 
      dengue virus, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2, 3 and 4. The susceptibility of 
      both monocyte subsets to infection was increased after IL-4 treatment, but this 
      increase was more profound for the CD16(+) monocyte subset, particularly at early 
      time points after virus exposure. These findings reveal the differential role that 
      monocyte subsets might play during dengue disease.

PG  - 1270-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen the molecules binding dengue II virus expressed in Aedes 
      albopictus C6/36 cells and characterize their biological functions. METHODS: Aedes 
      albopictus C6/36 cells were infected with dengue II virus, and the virus were 
      collected and purified. The total and membrane proteins of C6/36 cells were 
      extracted and analyzed using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (PAGE). After 
      electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and 
      virus overlay protein-binding assay (VOPBA) was carried out using an anti-dengue 
      virus 1-4 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Two specific bands of 67 000 and 30 000 
      occurred after VOPBA of the proteins from the cells incubated with the virus, while 
      the negative control group did not show these specific bands. CONCLUSION: Two 
      putative dengue virus receptor molecules of 67 000 and 30000 have been obtained from 
      C6/36 cells using VOPBA, and their functional identification is in progress.

AB  - Identification and characterization of virus-host interactions are very important 
      steps toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for 
      disease progression and pathogenesis. To date, very few cellular factors involved in 
      the life cycle of flaviviruses, which are important human pathogens, have been 
      described. In this study, we demonstrate a crucial role for class II Arf proteins 
      (Arf4 and Arf5) in the dengue flavivirus life cycle. We show that simultaneous 
      depletion of Arf4 and Arf5 blocks recombinant subviral particle secretion for all 
      four dengue serotypes. Immunostaining analysis suggests that class II Arf proteins 
      are required at an early pre-Golgi step for dengue virus secretion. Using a 
      horseradish peroxidase protein fused to a signal peptide, we show that class II Arfs 
      act specifically on dengue virus secretion without altering the secretion of 
      proteins through the constitutive secretory pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation data 
      demonstrate that the dengue prM glycoprotein interacts with class II Arf proteins 
      but not through its C-terminal VXPX motif. Finally, experiments performed with 
      replication-competent dengue and yellow fever viruses demonstrate that the depletion 
      of class II Arfs inhibits virus secretion, thus confirming their implication in the 
      virus life cycle, although data obtained with West Nile virus pointed out the 
      differences in virus-host interactions among flaviviruses. Our findings shed new 
      light on a molecular mechanism used by dengue viruses during the late stages of the 
      life cycle and demonstrate a novel function for class II Arf proteins.

      of dengue.
PG  - 246-53
LID - 10.1016/j.mjafi.2012.07.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is an emerging public health problem causing serious morbidity 
      and mortality in tropical developing countries. Early, sensitive and specific 
      diagnosis is paramount for clinical decision making. Currently available diagnostic 
      tests are limited in scope and utility. This study highlights applicability of 
      RT-LAMP in dengue diagnosis. METHODS: 100 dengue confirmed cases, 100 dengue 
      negative cases and 79 healthy negative controls from dengue epidemic between Sep 
      2009 to Jul 2011 were included. Dengue cases were profiled using WHO guidelines 
      2006, haematological and biochemical parameters evaluated and diagnosed using NS1 
      antigen, IgM and IgG enzyme immunoassay, RT-PCR and RT-LAMP. Positive cases were 
      serotyped, genotyped and various tests were compared. RESULTS: Mean haematocrit, PT, 
      PTT, platelet count, activated lymphocytes, serum fibrinogen, transaminases, 
      bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, protein and sodium were significantly elevated in 
      DHF/DSS as compared to DF. NS1 antigen, RT-PCR and RT-LAMP were sensitive during 1-3 
      days while μ-capture IgM EIA was specific after 5-7 days of initial infection. DEN-1 
      genotype III was predominant. CONCLUSION: Deranged haematocrit and liver function 
      tests are indicators of the severity of the disease. RT-LAMP is rapid, cost 
      effective, highly sensitive and specific qualitative and quantitative technique 
      which can detect dengue infection in both early and intermediary stages when NS1 
      antigen titres are not in the detectable range and the IgM antibody titres have just 
      started to rise. Its superiority over existing techniques, amenability for 
      automation and promising utility in low resource healthcare setups and field 
      conditions raise it as the new gold standard for dengue diagnosis.

AB  - Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are significant global public health 
      problems, and understanding the overall immune response to infection will contribute 
      to appropriate management of the disease and its potentially severe complications. 
      Live attenuated and subunit vaccine candidates, which are under clinical evaluation, 
      induce primarily an antibody response to the virus and minimal cross-reactive T-cell 
      responses. Currently, there are no available tools to assess protective T-cell 
      responses during infection or after vaccination. In this study, we utilize an 
      immunoproteomics process to uncover novel HLA-A2-specific epitopes derived from 
      dengue virus (DV)-infected cells. These epitopes are conserved, and we report that 
      epitope-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) are cross-reactive against all 4 DV 
      serotypes. These epitopes have potential as new informational and diagnostic tools 
      to characterize T-cell immunity in DV infection and may serve as part of a universal 
      vaccine candidate complementary to current vaccines in trial.

TI  - Ophthalmic complications of dengue Fever: a systematic review.
PG  - 2

LID - 2
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In recent years there has been a spurt of peer-reviewed publications 
      on the ophthalmic complications of dengue fever. The authors aim to review the 
      ocular manifestations, utility of relevant diagnostic tests, management, prognosis, 
      and sequelae of dengue-related ocular complications. METHODS: A comprehensive 
      literature search was conducted on Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. 
      Only articles published or translated into the English language were considered, and 
      key data from the full article of each paper was extracted and evaluated. RESULTS: 
      The authors' search yielded 29 articles. A total of 686 patients with a mean age of 
      33.4 years (range 14-73 years) were included. Blurring of vision was the most common 
      presenting symptom followed by scotoma. Ocular findings were mostly seen in the 
      posterior pole of the fundus, manifesting as retinal hemorrhages, macular edema, 
      foveolitis, vasculitis, and optic neuropathy. Most patients with dengue-related 
      ophthalmic complications recover spontaneously without any treatment. Patients with 
      severe visual loss or bilateral involvement were treated with systemic steroids and 
      occasionally immunoglobulins. Prognosis of dengue-related ophthalmic complications 
      is favorable; almost all patients had normal or showed improvement in visual acuity 
      and complete resolution of dengue ophthalmic complications was noted in almost all 
      cases. CONCLUSION: The pathological process of dengue ophthalmic complications is 
      complex and clinical manifestations varied. Ophthalmic complications are usually 
      seen in young adults who often present at the nadir of thrombocytopenia. Despite 
      good recovery of vision and resolution of clinical signs in most patients, 
      ophthalmologists and physicians should be aware and vigilant as isolated reports of 
      cases of dengue ophthalmic complications with poor visual acuity refractory to 
      treatment have been reported.

TI  - Investigation of the Cry4B-prohibitin interaction in Aedes aegypti cells.
PG  - 446-54
LID - 10.1007/s00284-012-0178-4 [doi]
AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces insecticidal toxins active against insects. 
      Cry4B, one of the major insecticidal toxins produced by Bt subsp. israelensis, is 
      highly toxic to mosquitoes in the genus Aedes: the major vectors of dengue, yellow 
      fever, and chikungunya. Previous work has shown that Cry4B binds to several mid-gut 
      membrane proteins in Aedes aegypti larvae including prohibitin, a protein recently 
      identified as a receptor that also mediates entry of dengue virus into Aedes cells. 
      This study confirms the interaction between Cry4B and prohibitin by 
      co-immunoprecipitation analysis and demonstrates colocalization of prohibitin and 
      Cry4B by confocal microscopy. While activated Cry4B toxin showed high larvicidal 
      activity, it was not cytotoxic to two Aedes cell lines, allowing determination of 
      its effect on dengue virus infectivity in the absence of Cry4B-induced cell lysis. 
      Pre-exposure of Aedes cells to Cry4B resulted in a significant reduction in the 
      number of infected cells compared to untreated cells.

TI  - Acute neuromuscular weakness associated with dengue infection.
PG  - 36-9
LID - 10.4103/0976-3147.91928 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue infections may present with neurological complications. Whether 
      these are due to neuromuscular disease or electrolyte imbalance is unclear. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight patients of dengue fever required 
      hospitalization during epidemic in year 2010. Twelve of them presented with acute 
      neuromuscular weakness. We enrolled them for study. Diagnosis of dengue infection 
      based on clinical profile of patients, positive serum IgM ELISA, NS1 antigen, and 
      sero-typing. Complete hemogram, kidney and liver functions, serum electrolytes, and 
      creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were tested. In addition, two patients underwent nerve 
      conduction velocity (NCV) test and electromyography. RESULTS: Twelve patients were 
      included in the present study. Their age was between 18 and 34 years. Fever, 
      myalgia, and motor weakness of limbs were most common presenting symptoms. Motor 
      weakness developed on 2(nd) to 4(th) day of illness in 11 of 12 patients. In one 
      patient, it developed on 10(th) day of illness. Ten of 12 showed hypokalemia. One 
      was of Guillain-Barré syndrome and other suffered from myositis; they underwent NCV 
      and electromyography. Serum CPK and SGOT raised in 8 out of 12 patients. CPK of 
      patient of myositis was 5098 IU. All of 12 patients had thrombocytopenia. WBC was in 
      normal range. Dengue virus was isolated in three patients, and it was of serotype 1. 
      CSF was normal in all. Within 24 hours, those with hypokalemia recovered by 
      potassium correction. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the dengue virus infection 
      led to acute neuromuscular weakness because of hypokalemia, myositis, and 
      Guillain-Barré syndrome. It was suggested to look for presence of hypokalemia in 
      such patients.

      HepG2 cells.
PG  - e34060
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0034060 [doi]
LID - e34060
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus-host cell interaction initiates when the virus binds to the 
      attachment receptors followed by endocytic internalization of the virus particle. 
      Successful entry into the cell is necessary for infection initiation. Currently, 
      there is no protective vaccine or antiviral treatment for dengue infection. 
      Targeting the viral entry pathway has become an attractive therapeutic strategy to 
      block infection. This study aimed to investigate the effect of silencing the GRP78 
      and clathrin-mediated endocytosis on dengue virus entry and multiplication into 
      HepG2 cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: HepG2 cells were transfected using 
      specific siRNAs to silence the cellular surface receptor (GRP78) and 
      clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. Gene expression analysis showed a marked 
      down-regulation of the targeted genes (87.2%, 90.3%, and 87.8% for GRP78, CLTC, and 
      DNM2 respectively) in transfected HepG2 cells when measured by RT-qPCR. 
      Intracellular and extracellular viral RNA loads were quantified by RT-qPCR to 
      investigate the effect of silencing the attachment receptor and clathrin-mediated 
      endocytosis on dengue virus entry. Silenced cells showed a significant reduction of 
      intracellular (92.4%) and extracellular viral RNA load (71.4%) compared to 
      non-silenced cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed a marked reduction of infected 
      cells (89.7%) in silenced HepG2 cells compared to non-silenced cells. Furthermore, 
      the ability to generate infectious virions using the plaque assay was reduced 1.07 
      log in silenced HepG2 cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Silencing the attachment 
      receptor and clathrin-mediated endocytosis using siRNA could inhibit dengue virus 
      entry and multiplication into HepG2 cells. This leads to reduction of infected cells 
      as well as the viral load, which might function as a unique and promising 
      therapeutic agent for attenuating dengue infection and prevent the development of 
      dengue fever to the severe life-threatening DHF or DSS. Furthermore, a decrease of 
      viremia in humans can result in the reduction of infected vectors and thus, halt of 
      the transmission cycle.

LID - e50995
AB  - Dengue virus infects approximately 100 million people annually, but there is no 
      available therapeutic treatment. The mimetic peptide, DN59, consists of residues 
      corresponding to the membrane interacting, amphipathic stem region of the dengue 
      virus envelope (E) glycoprotein. This peptide is inhibitory to all four serotypes of 
      dengue virus, as well as other flaviviruses. Cryo-electron microscopy image 
      reconstruction of dengue virus particles incubated with DN59 showed that the virus 
      particles were largely empty, concurrent with the formation of holes at the 
      five-fold vertices. The release of RNA from the viral particle following incubation 
      with DN59 was confirmed by increased sensitivity of the RNA genome to exogenous 
      RNase and separation of the genome from the E protein in a tartrate density 
      gradient. DN59 interacted strongly with synthetic lipid vesicles and caused membrane 
      disruptions, but was found to be non-toxic to mammalian and insect cells. Thus DN59 
      inhibits flavivirus infectivity by interacting directly with virus particles 
      resulting in release of the genomic RNA.

AB  - NS5 methyltransferase (Mtase) has a crucial role in the replication of dengue virus. 
      There are two active sites on NS5 Mtase i.e., SAM and RNA-cap binding sites. 
      Inhibition of the NS5 Mtase activity is expected to prevent the propagation of 
      dengue virus. This study was conducted to design cyclic peptide ligands as enzyme 
      inhibitors of dengue virus NS5 Mtase through computational approach. 
      Cyclopentapeptides were designed as ligand of SAM binding site as much as 1635 and 
      736 cyclopentpeptides were designed as ligand of RNA-cap binding site. Interaction 
      between ligand and NS5 Mtase has been conducted on the Docking simulation. The 
      result shows that cyclopentapeptide CTWYC was the best peptide candidate on SAM 
      binding site, with estimated free binding energy -30.72 kca/mol. Cyclopentapeptide 
      CYEFC was the best peptide on RNA-cap binding site with estimated free binding 
      energy -22.89 kcal/mol. Both peptides did not have tendency toward toxicity 
      properties. So it is expected that both CTWYC and CYEFC ligands could be used as a 
      potential antiviral drug candidates, which can inhibit the SAM and RNA-cap binding 
      sites of dengue virus NS5 Mtase.

AB  - We revisit the parameter estimation framework for population biological dynamical 
      systems, and apply it to calibrate various models in epidemiology with empirical 
      time series, namely influenza and dengue fever. When it comes to more complex models 
      such as multi-strain dynamics to describe the virus-host interaction in dengue 
      fever, even the most recently developed parameter estimation techniques, such as 
      maximum likelihood iterated filtering, reach their computational limits. However, 
      the first results of parameter estimation with data on dengue fever from Thailand 
      indicate a subtle interplay between stochasticity and the deterministic skeleton. 
      The deterministic system on its own already displays complex dynamics up to 
      deterministic chaos and coexistence of multiple attractors.

AB  - We bring to attention a characteristic parasitic pattern present in the dengue 
      virus: it undergoes several intensive thermodynamic variations due to host 
      environmental changes, from a vector's digestive tract, through the human 
      bloodstream and intracellular medium. Comparatively, among the known dengue 
      serotypes, we evaluate the effects that these medium variations may induce to the 
      overall structural characteristics of the Domain III of the envelope (E) protein, 
      checking for stereochemical congruences that could lead to the identification of 
      immunologic relevant regions. We used molecular dynamics and principal component 
      analysis to study the protein in solution, for all four dengue serotypes, under 
      distinct pH and temperature. We stated that, while the core of Domain III is 
      remarkably rigid and effectively unaffected by most of the mentioned intensive 
      variations, the loops account for major and distinguishable flexibilities. 
      Therefore, the rigidity of the Domain III core provides a foothold that projects 
      specifically two of these high flexible loop regions towards the inner face of the 
      envelope pores, which are found at every five-fold symmetry axis of the 
      icosahedron-shaped mature virus. These loops bear a remarkable low identity though 
      with high occurrence of ionizable residues, including histidines. Such 
      stereochemical properties can provide very particular serotype-specific 
      electrostatic surface patterns, suggesting a viral fingerprint region, on which 
      other specific molecules and ions can establish chemical interactions in an induced 
      fit mechanism. We assert that the proposed regions share enough relevant features to 
      qualify for further immunologic and pharmacologic essays, such as target peptide 
      synthesis and phage display using dengue patients' sera.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) can infect human dendritic cells (DCs), and cause a spectrum of 
      clinical symptoms. Envelope protein of DENV contains three distinct domains, 
      including domain I (DI), domain II (DII) and domain III (DIII), and plays important 
      roles in receptor binding and induction of protective antibodies. Previously, a new 
      DENV-2 type virus (named B strain) with eight gene mutations in DI of the envelope 
      protein was isolated from a dengue hemorrhagic fever patient. BALB/c mice infected 
      with DENV B strain showed more prolonged viremia than mice infected with the New 
      Guinea C (NGC) strain. However, the mechanism of prolonged viremia was not 
      determined. In this study, DI proteins derived from B and NGC strains of DENV were 
      expressed in Rosetta (DE3) host bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography 
      after refolding. A flow cytometry-based binding assay and confocal microscopy 
      indicated that both proteins could bind to human DCs induced from peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but DI of the B strain had a lower affinity than DI of 
      the NGC strain, and viable B virus also show less binding efficiency with DCs. In 
      addition, DI of the NGC strain, but not the B strain, induced IL-12 secretion and 
      phenotypic maturation of DCs, such as up-regulated expression of CD80, CD83, CD86 
      and HLA-DR. NGC strain could induce more virus specific IgM/IgG. These results 
      suggest that the naturally mutated envelope protein DI of the Chinese B strain of 
      DENV cannot induce DC maturation as high efficiency as that of NGC strain, which may 
      be the partial reason that DENV B strain escapes immune recognition and induce 
      prolonged viremia. The mutated B strain envelope protein is not a good candidate for 
      subunit vaccine target.

AB  - To determine the incidence of dengue infection, we established active surveillance 
      of febrile episodes in a cohort of schoolchildren from three schools in Medellin, 
      Colombia. We followed a cohort of 2,379 schoolchildren in 2010 and followed 1,840 of 
      these children the following year. During the follow-up time, 264 schoolchildren 
      displayed 297 febrile episodes; of these, 23 episodes (7.7%) were caused by acute 
      dengue infection. All four dengue serotypes were found, and all of the cases were 
      mild. The most common symptoms in the dengue cases compared with those in other 
      febrile illness were asthenia (96% versus 87%), anorexia (78% versus 57%), 
      rhinorrhea (65.2% versus 58%), abdominal pain (56.5% versus 47.8%), arthralgia (43% 
      versus 33%), and positive tourniquet test (13% versus 3%). This difference was not 
      statistically significant. Pulse was elevated, and systolic arterial pressure was 
      lower in dengue cases compared with other febrile illness (P < 0.05). Mosquito 
      indexes were determined in 8 children's houses and in the schools. Aedes aegypti 
      adults were found in both households and in schools, whereas Aedes aegypti larvae 
      were found only in schools. These results showed an elevated dengue frequency in 
      children, with symptoms similar to those of other febrile illness and transmission 
      risk in households and schools.

AB  - Our study presents a first investigation of the effect of the adjuvant PIKA on 
      dengue virus (DENV) replication. PIKA pretreatment decreased the levels of DENV 
      serotype 2 (DENV2) mRNA, protein and viral particles in the hepatoma cell line 
      HepG2. Treatment with PIKA simultaneously with DENV2 infection, but not after 
      infection, resulted in a protective effect. Significant induction of type I and type 
      III interferons (IFNs), as well as interferon-stimulated genes was detected in 
      PIKA-pretreated cells. Neutralization of IFN-β partially restored the replication 
      levels of DENV2 in PIKA-pretreated cells, suggesting that IFN-β is one of the 
      mediators involved in the antiviral action of PIKA. Additionally, blockade of TBK-1 
      signaling largely restored the IFN induction and viral suppression effects mediated 
      by PIKA, further illustrating that PIKA plays its anti-DENV role by promoting innate 
      immunity. These findings suggest that PIKA is an attractive agent to be used in the 
      prevention of DENV diseases.

TI  - A diagnostic polymerase chain reaction assay for Zika virus.
PG  - 1501-5
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23241 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus. Infection results in a dengue-like 
      illness with fever, headache, malaise, and a maculopapular rash. Nearly all cases 
      are mild and self-limiting but in 2007, a large outbreak of ZIKV was reported from 
      the island of Yap (in Micronesia, northwest of Indonesia). Singapore is already 
      endemic for dengue, and its impact on public health and economic burden is 
      significant. Other dengue-like infections (e.g., Chikungunya virus) are present. Yet 
      only 10% of reported dengue cases have laboratory confirmation. The identification 
      and control of other dengue-like, mosquito-transmitted infections is thus important 
      for the health of Singapore's population, as well as its economy. Given that ZIKV 
      shares the same Aedes mosquito vector with both dengue and Chikungunya, it is 
      possible that this virus is present in Singapore and causing some of the mild 
      dengue-like illness. A specific and sensitive one-step, reverse transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with an internal control (IC) was designed and 
      tested on 88 archived samples of dengue-negative, Chikungunya-negative sera from 
      patients presenting to our hospital with a dengue-like illness, to determine the 
      presence of ZIKV in Singapore. The assay was specific for detection of ZIKV and 
      displayed a lower limit of detection (LoD) of 140 copies viral RNA/reaction when 
      tested on synthetic RNA standards prepared using pooled negative patient plasma. Of 
      the 88 samples tested, none were positive for ZIKV RNA, however, the vast majority 
      of these were from patients admitted to hospital and further study may be warranted 
      in community-based environments.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of 2-phenyl-1-benzopyran-4-one (flavone) on 
      DENV-2 infectivity in Vero cells. Virus adsorption and attachment and intracellular 
      virus replication were investigated using a foci forming unit assay (FFUA) and 
      quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Addition of flavone (100 μg/mL) significantly 
      increased the number of DENV-2 foci by 35.66% ± 1.52 and 49.66% ± 2.51 when added 
      during and after virus adsorption to the Vero cells, respectively. The average foci 
      size after 4 days of infection increased by 33% ± 2.11 and 89% ± 2.13. The DENV-2 
      specific RNA copy number in the flavone-treated infected cells increased by 6.41- 
      and 23.1-fold when compared to the mock-treated infected cells. Flavone (100 μg/mL) 
      did not promote or inhibit Vero cell proliferation. The CC₅₀ value of flavone 
      against Vero cells was 446 µg/mL. These results suggest that flavone might enhance 
      dengue virus replication by acting antagonistically towards flavonoids known to 
      inhibit dengue virus replication.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV), the causative agent of human Dengue hemorrhagic 
      fever, is a mosquito-borne virus found in tropical and sub-tropical regions around 
      the world. Vaccines against DENV are currently unavailable. Guanylate-binding 
      protein 1 (GBP1) is one of the Interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs) and has been 
      shown important for host immune defense against various pathogens. However, the role 
      of GBP1 during DENV infection remains unclarified. In this study, we evaluated the 
      relevance of GBP1 to DENV infection in in vitro model. FINDINGS: Quantitative RT-PCR 
      (qRT-PCR) and Western blot showed that the expression of mouse Gbp1 was dramatically 
      upregulated in DENV-infected RAW264.7 cells. The intracellular DENV loads were 
      significantly higher in Gbp1 silenced cells compared with controls. The expression 
      levels of selective anti-viral cytokines were decreased in Gbp1 siRNA treated cells, 
      while the transcription factor activity of NF-κB was impaired upon GBP1 silencing 
      during infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that GBP1 plays an antiviral role 
      during DENV infection.

AB  - Dengue and West Nile viruses are enveloped RNA viruses that belong to genus 
      Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) and are considered important mosquito-borne viral 
      pathogenic agents worldwide. A potential target for intervention strategies is the 
      virus cell entry mechanism. Previous studies of flavivirus entry have focused on the 
      effects of biochemical and molecular inhibitors on viral entry leading to 
      controversial conclusions suggesting that the process is dependent upon endocytosis 
      and low pH mediated membrane fusion. In this study we analyzed the early events in 
      the infection process by means of electron microscopy and immuno-gold labeling of 
      viral particles during cell entry, and used as a new approach for infecting cells 
      with viruses obtained directly from mosquitoes. The results show that Dengue and 
      West Nile viruses may infect cells by a mechanism that involves direct penetration 
      of the host cell plasma membrane as proposed for alphaviruses.

AB  - In 1981, Cuba reported the first hemorrhagic dengue epidemic in the Americas, with 
      344,203 cases, including 10,312 severe and very severe cases, resulting in 158 
      deaths. In the 30 years following the epidemic, surveillance, control and research 
      have kept Cuba dengue free; although isolated, interrupted epidemics and 
      transmissions have been reported. In this article, we summarize issues of interest 
      regarding the 1981 epidemic, as well as laboratory surveillance data and various 
      related research results.

PG  - 238-45
LID - 10.1016/j.virusres.2011.09.040 [doi]
AB  - Despite aggressive efforts in dengue research, the control of dengue diseases and 
      discovery of therapeutics against them await complete elucidation of its complex 
      immune-pathogenesis. Unlike many viruses that escape the host's immune responses by 
      suppressing the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I pathway, many 
      Flaviviruses up-regulate the cell surface expression of MHC Class I complex. We 
      recently reported MHC Class I HLA-A2 promoter activation by all serotypes of dengue 
      virus (DV). The mechanism by which DV regulates this is further explored here in 
      HepG2 human liver cell line. Using real-time PCR, evidence that, similar to 
      infections by other Flaviviruses, DV infection has the ability to up-regulate the 
      MHC Class I transcription and mRNA synthesis, is presented. The region responsive 
      towards DV infection of all serotypes was mapped to the Class I Regulatory Complex 
      (CRC) of the HLA-A2 promoter. Competition electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
      (EMSA) with NFκB probe established the presence of specific DNA-protein complex in 
      DV-infected nuclear extracts. Antibody-supershift assays identified the MHC Class I 
      promoter activation by DV to occur through binding of p65/p50 heterodimers and p65 
      homodimers to κB1 and κB2 cis-acting elements, respectively, within the CRC, and not 
      with the interferon consensus sequence (ICS). This study presents evidence of MHC 
      Class I gene modulation by DV, hence providing a better understanding of dengue 
      immune-pathogenesis that would consequently facilitate the discovery of antiviral 
      therapeutics against dengue.

AB  - Dengue virus completes its protein synthesis inside human cells on the endoplasmic 
      reticulum membrane by processing the single-chain polyprotein precursor into 10 
      functional proteins. This vital process relies on the two-component virus-encoded 
      protease complex; nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) possesses the proteolytic activity 
      in its N-terminus, and NS2B acts as a fundamental activator and membrane-anchoring 
      subunit. The membrane-associated NS2B-NS3 complex has essentially not yet been 
      isolated or studied. We describe here a useful protocol for the preparation of the 
      full-length NS2B-NS3 complex from dengue serotype 2 virus by utilizing a 
      Mistic-fusion expression cassette in Escherichia coli. The protease complex was 
      successfully solubilized and stabilized from the bacterial membrane and purified 
      with the use of fos-choline-14 detergent. The detergent-solubilized protease complex 
      retained autolytic activity and, intriguingly, exists as a robust trimer, implying a 
      molecular assembly in the membrane. We further conducted a random mutagenesis study 
      to efficiently scan for entire residues and motifs contributing to autocleavage and 
      provide evidence of the importance of the two distal β-hairpins in the activity of 
      the viral protease. Our results provide the first comprehensive view of an active 
      dengue protease in the membrane-bound form.

AB  - The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) are the causative agents of the most 
      prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in human. No clinically approved antiviral 
      therapy is currently available. Therapeutic antibodies represent a viable approach 
      for potential treatment of DENV infection. We recently isolated a human monoclonal 
      antibody (HM14c10) that selectively neutralizes DENV serotype 1 (DENV-1), but not 
      serotypes 2, 3, and 4. Here we report the resistance profile of DENV-1 against 
      HM14c10 in cell culture. Escape mutant viruses readily emerged by culturing 
      wild-type DENV-1 in the presence of the HM14c10 antibody. Sequencing of resistant 
      viruses revealed a single T51K substitution in the domain I/II hinge region of the 
      viral envelope protein. Residue T51 is located within the HM14c10 epitope and is 
      highly conserved among various DENV-1 isolates. Recombinant DENV-1 containing the 
      T51K mutation could not be neutralized by HM14c10 in vitro or in vivo. Biochemical 
      assay revealed that the T51K mutation completely abolished the antibody binding to 
      the DENV-1 virion. Collectively, the results demonstrate that a single amino acid 
      change in DENV envelope protein can confer resistance to a potent antibody through 
      abolishing the antibody-virus interaction.

AB  - Dengue and West Nile viruses (WNV) are mosquito-borne members of flaviviruses that 
      cause significant morbidity and mortality. There is no approved vaccine or antiviral 
      drugs for human use to date. In this study, a series of functionalized meta and para 
      aminobenzamide derivatives were synthesized and subsequently screened in vitro 
      against Dengue virus and West Nile virus proteases. Four active compounds were 
      identified which showed comparable activity toward the two proteases and shared in 
      common a meta or para(phenoxy)phenyl group. The inhibition constants (K(i)) for the 
      most potent compound 7n against Dengue and West Nile virus proteases were 8.77 and 
      5.55 μM, respectively. The kinetics data support a competitive mode of inhibition of 
      both proteases by compound 7n. This conclusion is further supported by molecular 
      modeling. This study reveals a new chemical scaffold which is amenable to further 
      optimization to yield potent inhibitors of the viral proteases via the combined 
      utilization of iterative medicinal chemistry/structure-activity relationship studies 
      and in vitro screening.

      recombinant retrocyclin-1.
PG  - 314
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-12-314 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Global resurgence of dengue virus infections in many of the tropical and 
      subtropical countries is a major concern. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the 
      development of successful drugs that are both economical and offer a long-lasting 
      protection. The viral NS2B-NS3 serine protease (NS2B-NS3pro) is a promising target 
      for the development of drug-like inhibitors, which are not available at the moment. 
      In this study, we report retrocyclin-1 (RC-1) production in E. coli as a recombinant 
      peptide to test against dengue NS2B-NS3pro. METHODS: Dengue NS2B-NS3pro was produced 
      as a recombinant single chain protein in E. coli and purified by Ni+ affinity 
      chromatography. The RC-1 peptide was produced in E. coli and the tri-disulphide 
      bonds were reformed in a diluted alkaline environment. Protease assay was performed 
      using a fluorogenic peptide substrate and measured by fluorescence spectrometry. 
      Real-time PCR was used for quantification of dengue serotype 2 (DENV-2) viral RNA 
      produced in Vero cells. RESULTS: The RC-1 peptide inhibited the activity of 
      recombinant NS2B-NS3pro with different values at 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) 
      which are temperature dependent (28°C, 46.1 ± 1.7 μM; 37°C, 21.4 ± 1.6 μM; 40°C, 
      14.1 ± 1.2 μM). The presence of RC-1 significantly reduced viral replication in Vero 
      cells infected with DENV-2 at simultaneous treatment after 48 hrs (70%) and 75 hrs 
      (85%). Furthermore, moderate reduction in viral replication was observed at 
      pre-treatment mode after 48 hrs (40%) and 72 hrs (38%) and post-treatment at 48 hrs 
      (30%) and 72 hrs (45%). CONCLUSION: Recombinant RC-1 inhibits DENV-2 replication in 
      Vero cells by interfering with the activity of its serine protease. Thus, we propose 
      that recombinant RC-1 is a potent, cost-effective dengue virus inhibitor. Therefore, 
      it is suitable to consider RC-1 as a new candidate for drug development against 
      dengue infection.

TI  - MicroRNA targeting of neurotropic flavivirus: effective control of virus escape and 
      reversion to neurovirulent phenotype.
PG  - 5647-59
LID - 10.1128/JVI.07125-11 [doi]
AB  - Neurotropic flaviviruses can efficiently replicate in the developing and mature 
      central nervous systems (CNS) of mice causing lethal encephalitis. Insertion of a 
      single copy of a target for brain-expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in the 3' noncoding 
      region (3'NCR) of the flavivirus genome (chimeric tick-borne encephalitis 
      virus/dengue virus) abolished virus neurovirulence in the mature mouse CNS. However, 
      in the developing CNS of highly permissive suckling mice, the miRNA-targeted viruses 
      can revert to a neurovirulent phenotype by accumulating deletions or mutations 
      within the miRNA target sequence. Virus escape from miRNA-mediated suppression in 
      the developing CNS was markedly diminished by increasing the number of miRNA target 
      sites and by extending the distance between these sites in the virus genome. 
      Insertion of multiple miRNA targets into the 3'NCR altered virus neuroinvasiveness, 
      decreased neurovirulence and neuroinflammatory responses, and prevented 
      neurodegeneration without loss of immunogenicity. Although the onset of encephalitis 
      was delayed, a small number of suckling mice still succumbed to lethal intracerebral 
      infection with the miRNA-targeted viruses. Sequence analysis of brain isolates from 
      moribund mice revealed that the viruses escaped from miRNA-mediated suppression 
      exclusively through the deletion of miRNA targets and viral genome sequence located 
      between the two miRNA targets separated by the greatest distance. These findings 
      offer a general strategy to control the reversion of virus to a virulent phenotype: 
      a simultaneous miRNA targeting of the viral genome at many different functionally 
      important regions could prevent virus escape from miRNA-based attenuation, since a 
      deletion of the targeted genomic sequences located between the inserted miRNA 
      binding sites would be lethal for the virus.

LID - e1536
AB  - BACKGROUND: Progress in dengue vaccine development has been hampered by limited 
      understanding of protective immunity against dengue virus infection. Conventional 
      neutralizing antibody titration assays that use FcγR-negative cells do not consider 
      possible infection-enhancement activity. We reasoned that as FcγR-expressing cells 
      are the major target cells of dengue virus, neutralizing antibody titration assays 
      using FcγR-expressing cells that determine the sum of neutralizing and 
      infection-enhancing activity, may better reflect the biological properties of 
      antibodies in vivo. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated serum samples from 80 
      residents of a dengue endemic country, Malaysia, for neutralizing activity, and 
      infection-enhancing activity at 1∶10 serum dilution by using FcγR-negative BHK cells 
      and FcγR-expressing BHK cells. The serum samples consisted of a panel of patients 
      with acute DENV infection (31%, 25/80) and a panel of donors without acute DENV 
      infection (69%, 55/80). A high proportion of the tested serum samples (75%, 60/80) 
      demonstrated DENV neutralizing activity (PRNT(50)≥10) and infection-enhancing 
      activity. Eleven of 18 serum samples from patients with acute secondary DENV 
      infection demonstrated neutralizing activity to the infecting serotype determined by 
      using FcγR-negative BHK cells (PRNT(50)≥10), but not when determined by using 
      FcγR-expressing cells. CONCLUSION: Human serum samples with low neutralizing 
      activity determined by using FcγR-negative cells showed DENV infection-enhancing 
      activity using FcγR-expressing cells, whereas those with high neutralizing activity 
      determined by using FcγR-negative cells demonstrate low or no infection-enhancing 
      activity using FcγR-expressing cells. The results suggest an inverse relationship 
      between neutralizing antibody titer and infection-enhancing activity, and that 
      neutralizing activity determined by using FcγR-expressing cells, and not the 
      activity determined by using FcγR-negative cells, may better reflect protection to 
      DENV infection in vivo.

AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever is characterized by a unique vascular leakage syndrome. The 
      mechanisms of endothelial barrier dysfunction in dengue hemorrhagic fever are not 
      well understood. We examined the modulation of endothelial barrier function in 
      dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) infections using primary human umbilical vein 
      endothelial cells. We demonstrated that the increase in endothelial barrier function 
      within 72 hours after DENV2 infection is mediated by type I interferon-dependent 
      CD73 up-regulation. After 72 hours, DENV2 slowed the recovery of endothelial barrier 
      function in response to tumor necrosis factor-α or vascular endothelial growth 
      factor. This phenomenon was likely caused by type I interferon receptor signaling 
      inhibition and lower CD73 levels in DENV2-infected endothelial cells. Our findings 
      suggest that during DENV2 infection, endothelial barrier homeostasis is maintained 
      by a balance between pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic cytokines, and type I 
      interferon-dependent CD73 expression and activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by four closely related 
      serotypes of Dengue viruses (DENVs). This disease whose symptoms range from mild 
      fever to potentially fatal haemorrhagic fever and hypovolemic shock, threatens 
      nearly half the global population. There is neither a preventive vaccine nor an 
      effective antiviral therapy against dengue disease. The difference between severe 
      and mild disease appears to be dependent on the viral load. Early diagnosis may 
      enable timely therapeutic intervention to blunt disease severity by reducing the 
      viral load. Harnessing the therapeutic potential of RNA interference (RNAi) to 
      attenuate DENV replication may offer one approach to dengue therapy. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We screened the non-translated regions (NTRs) of the 
      RNA genomes of representative members of the four DENV serotypes for putative siRNA 
      targets mapping to known transcription/translation regulatory elements. We 
      identified a target site in the 5' NTR that maps to the 5' upstream AUG region, a 
      highly conserved cis-acting element essential for viral replication. We used a 
      replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 (AdV5) vector to deliver a 
      short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting this site into cells. We show that this shRNA 
      matures to the cognate siRNA and is able to inhibit effectively antigen secretion, 
      viral RNA replication and infectious virus production by all four DENV serotypes. 
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The data demonstrate the feasibility of using AdV5-mediated 
      delivery of shRNAs targeting conserved sites in the viral genome to achieve 
      inhibition of all four DENV serotypes. This paves the way towards exploration of 
      RNAi as a possible therapeutic strategy to curtail DENV infection.

AB  - Regulated by pH, membrane-anchored proteins E and M function during dengue virus 
      maturation and membrane fusion. Our atomic model of the whole virion from 
      cryo-electron microscopy at 3.5-Å resolution reveals that in the mature virus at 
      neutral extracellular pH, the N-terminal 20-amino-acid segment of M (involving three 
      pH-sensing histidines) latches and thereby prevents spring-loaded E fusion protein 
      from prematurely exposing its fusion peptide. This M latch is fastened at an earlier 
      stage, during maturation at acidic pH in the trans-Golgi network. At a later stage, 
      to initiate infection in response to acidic pH in the late endosome, M releases the 
      latch and exposes the fusion peptide. Thus, M serves as a multistep chaperone of E 
      to control the conformational changes accompanying maturation and infection. These 
      pH-sensitive interactions could serve as targets for drug discovery.

TI  - The importance of hematopoietic progenitor cells in dengue.
PG  - 59-71
LID - 10.1177/2040620711417660 [doi]
AB  - Scientific investigations designed to better understand and assess the 
      distinguishing clinical characteristics pave the way to a successful treatment for a 
      disease. Since the peripheral blood is obtained easily, the most frequent type of 
      investigation performed on infectious agents focuses on the hematological components 
      of blood drawn from patients. Bone marrow aspirates, although somewhat more 
      difficult to obtain, should be evaluated more frequently because they provide 
      additional information, giving us a glimpse into the development of the disease. 
      Understanding the distinct and unique changes in hematological components of the 
      bone marrow induced by a particular pathogen or corresponding to a specific illness 
      may be a valuable asset for the diagnosis and prognosis of disease. A good example 
      of a pathogen that could be better evaluated with greater knowledge of the bone 
      marrow is dengue, one of the most important public vector-borne human diseases. 
      Owing to the multitude of clinical manifestations and the dynamic alterations of 
      various blood components over time, this disease is one of the most difficult to 
      prevent and treat in humans. Although large amounts of data have been generated in 
      the literature, there remains a large gap between this information and its relevance 
      for the purpose of patient care. While evaluating the cellular components in the 
      circulated blood from ill patients provides us with valuable information about the 
      pathogenesis of various pathogens, there are other players participating in the 
      progression to disease. The goal of this review is to emphasize the importance of 
      bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells in disease and to inspire other 
      researchers to incorporate them into their investigations on dengue pathogenesis. It 
      is anticipated that the knowledge derived from these investigations not only elicit 
      original concepts on the pathogenesis of dengue but also foster a new way of 
      thinking in terms of vaccine or therapeutic development to prevent and treat dengue.

AB  - This study considers the dengue occurrence in the city of Belo Horizonte over the 
      last fifteen years. Approximately 186,000 cases registered from 1996 to 2011 were 
      analyzed. The home address of individuals whose dengue case was notified was used as 
      a proxy for exposure location. For determining possible outbreaks of disease and the 
      specific patterns of dengue cases, spatial statistics used included Kernel's 
      estimation. The occurrence of waves of dengue outbreaks was correlated with climatic 
      and vector presence data. Outbreaks had different durations and intensities: case 
      clustering, thinned out both spatially and temporally. These findings may be useful 
      for public health professionals responsible for fighting the disease providing some 
      tools for improving evaluation of interventions such as vector control and patient 
      care, minimizing the collective and individual burden of the disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue includes a broad range of symptoms, ranging from fever to 
      hemorrhagic fever and may occasionally have alternative clinical presentations. Many 
      possible viral genetic determinants of the intrinsic virulence of dengue virus 
      (DENV) in the host have been identified, but no conclusive evidence of a correlation 
      between viral genotype and virus transmissibility and pathogenicity has been 
      obtained. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used reverse genetics techniques to 
      engineer DENV-1 viruses with subsets of mutations found in two different 
      neuroadapted derivatives. The mutations were inserted into an infectious clone of 
      DENV-1 not adapted to mice. The replication and viral production capacity of the 
      recombinant viruses were assessed in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated 
      that paired mutations in the envelope protein (E) and in the helicase domain of the 
      NS3 (NS3(hel)) protein had a synergistic effect enhancing viral fitness in human and 
      mosquito derived cell lines. E mutations alone generated no detectable virulence in 
      the mouse model; however, the combination of these mutations with NS3(hel) 
      mutations, which were mildly virulent on their own, resulted in a highly 
      neurovirulent phenotype. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The generation of recombinant 
      viruses carrying specific E and NS3(hel) proteins mutations increased viral fitness 
      both in vitro and in vivo by increasing RNA synthesis and viral load (these changes 
      being positively correlated with central nervous system damage), the strength of the 
      immune response and animal mortality. The introduction of only pairs of amino acid 
      substitutions into the genome of a non-mouse adapted DENV-1 strain was sufficient to 
      alter viral fitness substantially. Given current limitations to our understanding of 
      the molecular basis of dengue neuropathogenesis, these results could contribute to 
      the development of attenuated strains for use in vaccinations and provide insights 
      into virus/host interactions and new information about the mechanisms of basic 
      dengue biology.

TI  - New pockets in dengue virus 2 surface identified by molecular dynamics simulation.
PG  - 1369-77
LID - 10.1007/s00894-012-1687-6 [doi]
AB  - One of the factors limiting the search of new compounds based on the structure of 
      target proteins involved in diseases is the limited amount of target structural 
      information. Great advances in the search for lead compounds could be achieved to 
      find new cavities in protein structures that are generated using well established 
      computational chemistry tools. In the case of dengue, the discovery of pockets in 
      the crystallographic structure of the E protein has contributed to the search for 
      lead compounds aimed at interfering in conformational transitions involved in the 
      pH-dependent fusion process. This is a complex mechanism triggered by the acid pH of 
      the endosomes that leads to the initial changes in the E protein assembly at the 
      virus surface. In the present work, an arrangement of three ectodomain portions of 
      the E protein present on the surface of the mature dengue virus was studied through 
      long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent. In order to 
      identify new pockets and to evaluate the influence of the acid pH on these pockets, 
      the physiological neutral pH conditions and the acid pH of the endosomes that 
      trigger the fusion process were modeled. Several pockets presenting pH-dependent 
      characteristics were found in the contact regions between the chains. Pockets at the 
      protein-protein interfaces induced by a monomer in another monomer were also found. 
      Some of the pockets are good candidates for the design of lead compounds that could 
      interfere in the rearrangements in E proteins along the fusion process contributing 
      to the development of specific inhibitors of the dengue disease.

AB  - Objective. To determine the prevalence of leptospirosis in patients from Veracruz 
      with initial diagnosis of dengue and its association with risk factors. Materials 
      and Methods. Transversal study in patients who sought medical attention under the 
      suspicion of dengue. Backgrounds were researched and blood samples were drawn to 
      determine dengue (NS1, RT-PCR) and leptospirosis (IFI). Simple frequencies, central 
      tendency and dispersion measures, and prevalence and trust intervals at 95% (IC95%) 
      were obtained. Prevalence reasons (RP) and IC(95%) were obtained and a multivariate 
      logistic model was applied, using SPSS V15. Results. 171 patients were included, 56% 
      women (32 ± 14 years) and 44% men (32 ± 17 years). 48% of the cases 
      (IC95% 40.5-55.4) was positive to dengue, with a cut point of 1 : 80, seroprevalence 
      for leptospirosis was of 6% (IC(95%) 2.7-10); 12% (IC95% 7-16.5) was positive to 
      both pathologies and 34% was negative to both tests. Although the largest number of 
      isolations corresponded to serotype 2, the four dengue virus serotypes were 
      identified. In the bivariate analysis, overcrowding RP = 1.33, (IC = 0.46-3.5), 
      bathing in rivers (RP = 1.31, IC = 0.13-7.4), and walking barefoot (RP = 1.39, 
      IC = 0.58-3.3) were the variables associated with leptospirosis, although the 
      relation was not statistically significant. Conclusions. Leptospirosis prevalence in 
      subjects under suspicion of dengue fever is high, as well as the coincidence of both 
      infections. The results show the coexistence of overlapped outbreaks of several 
      diseases sharing the side of transmission. It is necessary the intentional search of 
      other pathologies, such as influenza, rickettsiosis, and brucella, among others.

AB  - Development of anti-dengue therapy represents an urgent un-met medical need. Towards 
      antiviral therapy, recent advances in crystal structures of DENV enzymes have led to 
      the possibility of structure-based rational design of inhibitors for anti-dengue 
      therapy. These include (i) the structure of the 'active' form of the DENV protease 
      in complex with a peptide substrate; (ii) the structure of DENV methyltransferase 
      bound to an inhibitor that selectively suppresses viral methyltransferase, but not 
      human methyltransferases; (iii) the structure of DENV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
      in complex with a small-molecule compound. This review summarizes the structural 
      biology of these three key enzymes (protease, methyltransferase, and polymerase) 
      that are essential for DENV replication. The new structural information has provided 
      new avenues for development of anti-dengue therapy.

PG  - 6278-93
LID - 10.1021/jm300146f [doi]
AB  - By virtual screening, compound 1 was found to be active against NS2B-NS3 protease 
      (IC(50) = 13.12 ± 1.03 μM). Fourteen derivatives (22) of compound 1 were 
      synthesized, leading to the discovery of four new inhibitors with biological 
      activity. In order to expand the chemical diversity of the inhibitors, 
      small-molecule-based scaffold hopping was performed on the basis of the common 
      scaffold of compounds 1 and 22. Twenty-one new compounds (23, 24) containing 
      quinoline (new scaffold) were designed and synthesized. Protease inhibition assays 
      revealed that 12 compounds with the new scaffold are inhibitors of NS2B-NS3 
      protease. Taken together, 17 new compounds were discovered as NS2B-NS3 protease 
      inhibitors with IC(50) values of 7.46 ± 1.15 to 48.59 ± 3.46 μM, and 8 compounds 
      belonging to two different scaffolds are active to some extent against DENV based on 
      luciferase reporter replicon-based assays. These novel chemical entities could serve 
      as lead structures for discovering therapies against DENV.

AB  - Epidemic dengue has emerged throughout the tropical world. In the continued absence 
      of a vaccine against dengue virus (DENV), mosquito vector surveillance and control 
      programs are essential to reduce human infections. An effective test to detect DENV 
      in infected mosquitoes would be a valuable addition to the surveillance effort. We 
      investigated DENV detection in infected Aedes aegypti using a commercially available 
      DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) ELISA kit (Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag), and by 
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation assays. 
      The DENV-infected mosquitoes were subjected to field-relevant conditions and assayed 
      individually and pooled with uninfected mosquitoes. Overall, DENV NS1 antigen was 
      detected in 98% of infected mosquitoes/pools versus 79% for RT-PCR and 29% for virus 
      isolation. Our results indicate that NS1 is an excellent analyte for detection of 
      DENV in Ae. aegypti and that the tested NS1 antigen kit provides a sensitive, rapid, 
      and convenient test for DENV surveillance in mosquitoes.

AB  - The level of cholesterol in host cells has been shown to affect viral infection. 
      However, it is still not understood why this level of regulation is important for 
      successful infection. We have shown in this study that dengue virus infection was 
      affected when the cholesterol intake in infected cells was disrupted using a 
      cholesterol transport inhibitor, U18666A. The antiviral effect was found to result 
      from two events: retarded viral trafficking in the cholesterol-loaded late 
      endosomes/lysosomes and suppressed de novo sterol biosynthesis in treated infected 
      cells. We also observed an additive antiviral effect of U18666A with C75, a fatty 
      acid synthase inhibitor, suggesting dengue virus relies on both the host cholesterol 
      and fatty acid biosynthesis for successful replication.

AB  - A nanoporous alumina membrane-based ultrasensitive DNA biosensor is constructed 
      using 5'-aminated DNA probes immobilized onto the alumina channel walls. Alumina 
      nanoporous membrane-like structure is carved over platinum wire electrode of 76 µm 
      diameter dimension by electrochemical anodization. The hybridization of 
      complementary target DNA with probe DNA molecules attached inside the pores 
      influences the pore size and ionic conductivity. The biosensor demonstrates linear 
      range over 6 order of magnitude with ultrasensitive detection limit of 9.55×10(-12) 
      M for the quantification of ss-31 mer DNA sequence. Its applicability is challenged 
      against real time cDNA PCR sample of dengue virus serotype1 derived from asymmetric 
      PCR. Excellent specificity down to one nucleotide mismatch in target DNA sample of 
      DENV3 is also demonstrated.

AB  - The results of a high-throughput screening assay using the DENV-2 replicon showed 
      that the 2,4-diaminoquinazoline derivative 4a has a high dengue virus inhibitory 
      activity (EC(50) = 0.15 μM). A series of 2,4-diaminoquinazoline derivatives based on 
      4a as a lead compound were synthesized and subjected to structure-antidengue 
      activity relationship studies. Among the series of 2,4-diaminoquinazoline derivative 
      probed, 4o was observed to display both the highest antiviral potency (EC(50) = 2.8 
      nM, SI > 1000) and an excellent pharmacokinetic profile.

TI  - Ivermectin is a specific inhibitor of importin α/β-mediated nuclear import able to 
      inhibit replication of HIV-1 and dengue virus.
PG  - 851-6
LID - 10.1042/BJ20120150 [doi]
AB  - The movement of proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus mediated by the importin 
      superfamily of proteins is essential to many cellular processes, including 
      differentiation and development, and is critical to disease states such as viral 
      disease and oncogenesis. We recently developed a high-throughput screen to identify 
      specific and general inhibitors of protein nuclear import, from which ivermectin was 
      identified as a potential inhibitor of importin α/β-mediated transport. In the 
      present study, we characterized in detail the nuclear transport inhibitory 
      properties of ivermectin, demonstrating that it is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of 
      importin α/β nuclear import, with no effect on a range of other nuclear import 
      pathways, including that mediated by importin β1 alone. Importantly, we establish 
      for the first time that ivermectin has potent antiviral activity towards both HIV-1 
      and dengue virus, both of which are strongly reliant on importin α/β nuclear import, 
      with respect to the HIV-1 integrase and NS5 (non-structural protein 5) polymerase 
      proteins respectively. Ivermectin would appear to be an invaluable tool for the 
      study of protein nuclear import, as well as the basis for future development of 
      antiviral agents.

TI  - Epstein-Barr virus co-infection in a patient with dengue fever presenting with 
      post-infectious cerebellitis: a case report.
PG  - 43
LID - 10.1186/1752-1947-6-43 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Post-infectious cerebellitis is an acute form of inflammatory 
      encephalitis mainly limited to the cerebellum. It is commonly found in children, 
      especially after viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus. Post-infectious 
      cerebellitis presents with acute onset dysarthria and ataxia. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the first case report of post-infectious cerebellitis in a 
      patient with both dengue and Epstein-Barr viral infection confirmed on serology. 
      CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old Sri Lankan Sinhala man presented with an acute 
      febrile illness associated with thrombocytopenia. While being managed as 
      uncomplicated dengue fever, our patient developed dysarthria, ataxia and cerebellar 
      signs. Our patient's infectious disease screen was positive for both dengue and 
      Epstein-Barr specific immunoglobulin M. A cerebrospinal fluid analysis was 
      suggestive of viral meningoencephalitis while cerebrospinal fluid serology was 
      positive for dengue immunoglobulin G. T2-weighted magnetic resonance images were 
      consistent with post-viral cerebellitis. The patient was given full supportive care 
      and he made an uneventful complete recovery. CONCLUSION: There have been no 
      previously reported cases of post-infectious cerebellitis associated with both 
      Epstein-Barr and dengue viral infections confirmed by serology. Our patient's 
      clinical features and findings on the imaging studies were consistent with 
      post-viral cerebellitis. This report highlights the need to screen for other 
      possible more common etiologies of a particular presentation before coming to a 
      specific diagnosis based on initial findings. Uncomplicated cases of cerebellitis 
      can be successfully managed with appropriate supportive measures with good 
      prognosis, as in this case.

LID - 10.1007/s00705-012-1525-2 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus is the most important arbovirus that affects humans, and it can 
      establish persistent infections, especially in insect-derived cell cultures. 
      Defective viral genomes have been implicated in the establishment and maintenance of 
      persistent infections with several flaviviruses; however, there exists almost no 
      information concerning defective dengue virus genomes. Here, we report the detection 
      of defective dengue 2 virus genomes in persistently infected mosquito C6/36 cells. 
      The defective viral genomes were detected at a low ratio compared with the wild-type 
      genome. Deletions of approximately 147 residues (222-368) were found in the E 
      protein, and these mainly affected domain III (73 %) of the protein; deletions of 
      approximately 153 residues (4-156) and 228 residues (597-825) were found in the 
      methyltransferase and polymerase domains, respectively, of the NS5 protein. The 
      truncated versions of NS5 could be detected by western blot only in the protein 
      extracts derived from persistently infected cells.

AB  - Dengue is the most important arbovirus in the world with an estimated of 50 million 
      dengue infections occurring annually and approximately 2.5 billion people living in 
      dengue endemic countries. Yellow fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever with high 
      mortality that is transmitted by mosquitoes. Effective vaccines against yellow fever 
      have been available for almost 70 years and are responsible for a significant 
      reduction of occurrences of the disease worldwide; however, approximately 200,000 
      cases of yellow fever still occur annually, principally in Africa. Therefore, it is 
      a public health priority to develop antiviral agents for treatment of these virus 
      infections. Crotalus durissus terrificus snake, a South American rattlesnake, 
      presents venom with several biologically actives molecules. In this study, we 
      evaluated the antiviral activity of crude venom and isolated toxins from Crotalus 
      durissus terrificus and found that phospholipases A₂ showed a high inhibition of 
      Yellow fever and dengue viruses in VERO E6 cells.

AB  - A series of 12 carbohydrate compounds were synthesized by introduction of a sulfated 
      group at specific positions and evaluated for their activities against dengue virus 
      (DENV) infection as well as binding to BHK-21 cells. 3-O-sulfated GlcA was active 
      against DENV infection, whereas 2-O-sulfated GlcA and 3,6-di-O-sulfated Glc showed 
      negligible activity. Persulfated compounds did not inhibit DENV infection. These 
      results provided a rationale for designing sulfated carbohydrate compounds with low 
      molecular mass as anti-DENV agents targeting E protein functions. 3-O-Sulfated GlcA 
      showed no significant cytotoxicity at 1mM. The EC(50) value (120 μM) was lower than 
      that of sucrose octasulfate (SOS), a small molecular weight inhibitor of DENV 
      infection. Two negatively charged groups, 3-O-sulfate and 6-C-carboxylic acid, 
      appear to be essential for anti-DENV activity. We performed docking study to 
      investigate the binding potential of 3-O-sulfated GlcA with respect to DENV E 
      protein. The docking study showed that distance and conformation of these negative 
      charges on the carbohydrate may be suitable for association with three amino acid 
      residues of E protein critically involved in virus adsorption (Lys295, Ser145, and 
      Gly159). This interaction may competitively prevent functional DENV binding to 
      receptor(s) on host cells. In conclusion, 3-O-sulfated GlcA is a chemical probe that 
      may facilitate exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying manifestations of 
      dengue diseases.

AB  - Cross-reactive dengue virus (DENV) antibodies directed against the envelope (E) and 
      precursor membrane (prM) proteins are believed to contribute to the development of 
      severe dengue disease by facilitating antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. 
      We and others recently demonstrated that anti-prM antibodies render essentially 
      non-infectious immature DENV infectious in Fcγ-receptor-expressing cells. Immature 
      DENV particles are abundantly present in standard (st) virus preparations due to 
      inefficient processing of prM to M during virus maturation. Structural analysis has 
      revealed that the E protein is exposed in immature particles and this prompted us to 
      investigate whether antibodies to E render immature particles infectious. To this 
      end, we analyzed the enhancing properties of 27 anti-E antibodies directed against 
      distinct structural domains. Of these, 23 bound to immature particles, and 15 
      enhanced infectivity of immature DENV in a furin-dependent manner. The significance 
      of these findings was subsequently tested in vivo using the well-established West 
      Nile virus (WNV) mouse model. Remarkably, mice injected with immature WNV opsonized 
      with anti-E mAbs or immune serum produced a lethal infection in a dose-dependent 
      manner, whereas in the absence of antibody immature WNV virions caused no morbidity 
      or mortality. Furthermore, enhancement infection studies with standard (st) DENV 
      preparations opsonized with anti-E mAbs in the presence or absence of furin 
      inhibitor revealed that prM-containing particles present within st virus 
      preparations contribute to antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Taken 
      together, our results support the notion that antibodies against the structural 
      proteins prM and E both can promote pathogenesis by enhancing infectivity of 
      prM-containing immature and partially mature flavivirus particles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The chikungunya (CHIK) outbreak that struck La Reunion Island in 2005 
      was preceded by few human cases of Dengue (DEN), but which surprisingly did not lead 
      to an epidemic as might have been expected in a non-immune population. Both 
      arboviral diseases are transmitted to humans by two main mosquito species, Aedes 
      aegypti and Aedes albopictus. In the absence of the former, Ae. albopictus was the 
      only species responsible for viral transmission on La Reunion Island. This mosquito 
      is naturally super-infected with two Wolbachia strains, wAlbA and wAlbB. While 
      Wolbachia does not affect replication of CHIK virus (CHIKV) in Ae. albopictus, a 
      similar effect was not observed with DEN virus (DENV). METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 
      To understand the weak vectorial status of Ae. albopictus towards DENV, we used 
      experimental oral infections of mosquitoes from La Reunion Island to characterize 
      the impact of Wolbachia on DENV infection. Viral loads and Wolbachia densities were 
      measured by quantitative PCR in different organs of Ae. albopictus where DENV 
      replication takes place after ingestion. We found that: (i) Wolbachia does not 
      affect viral replication, (ii) Wolbachia restricts viral density in salivary glands, 
      and (iii) Wolbachia limits transmission of DENV, as infectious viral particles were 
      only detected in the saliva of Wolbachia-uninfected Ae. albopictus, 14 days after 
      the infectious blood-meal. CONCLUSIONS: We show that Wolbachia does not affect the 
      replication of DENV in Ae. albopictus. However, Wolbachia is able to reduce viral 
      infection of salivary glands and limit transmission, suggesting a role of Wolbachia 
      in naturally restricting the transmission of DENV in Ae. albopictus from La Reunion 
      Island. The extension of this conclusion to other Ae. albopictus populations should 
      be investigated.

AB  - Dengue is one of the major public health concerns in the world. Since all the four 
      serotypes are actively circulating in Mexico, there is a need to develop an 
      efficient diagnosis system to improve case management of the patients. There exist 
      few studies evaluating the use of the NS3 protein as a protective antigen against 
      dengue virus (DENV). In this paper we show the expression of a recombinant NS3 
      protein from all serotypes of dengue virus (GST-DVNS3-1-4) and report a reliable 
      "in-house detection system" for the diagnosis of dengue infection which was 
      field-tested in a small village (Tezonapa) in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. The 
      fusion proteins were immunogenic, inducing antibodies to be able to recognize to 
      antigens up to a 1 : 3200 dilution. The purified proteins were used to develop an 
      in-house detection system (ELISA) and were further tested with a panel of 239 serum 
      samples. The in-house results were in excellent agreement with the commercial kits 
      with κ = 0.934 ± 0.064 (95%  CI = 0.808-1.061), and κ = 0.872 ± 0.048 (95%  CI = 
      0.779-0.965) for IgM and IgG, respectively. The agreement between the NS1 antigen 
      detection versus the rNS3 ELISA, κ = 0.837 ± 0.066 (95%  CI = 0.708-0.966), was very 
      good. Thus, these results demonstrate that recombinant NS3 proteins have potential 
      in early diagnosis of dengue infections.

AB  - Cytopathic effects (CPEs) in mosquito cells are generally trivial compared to those 
      that occur in mammalian cells, which usually end up undergoing apoptosis during 
      dengue virus (DENV) infection. However, oxidative stress was detected in both types 
      of infected cells. Despite this, the survival of mosquito cells benefits from the 
      upregulation of genes related to antioxidant defense, such as glutathione S 
      transferase (GST). A second defense system, i.e., consisting of antiapoptotic 
      effects, was also shown to play a role in protecting mosquito cells against DENV 
      infection. This system is regulated by an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) that is an 
      upstream regulator of caspases-9 and -3. DENV-infected C6/36 cells with double 
      knockdown of GST and the IAP showed a synergistic effect on activation of these two 
      caspases, causing a higher rate of apoptosis (> 20%) than those with knockdown of 
      each single gene (-10%). It seems that the IAP acts as a second line of defense with 
      an additional effect on the survival of mosquito cells with DENV infection. Compared 
      to mammalian cells, residual hydrogen peroxide in DENV-infected C6/36 cells may 
      signal for upregulation of the IAP. This novel finding sheds light on virus/cell 
      interactions and their coevolution that may elucidate how mosquitoes can be a vector 
      of DENV and probably most other arboviruses in nature.

TI  - Mechanism of dengue virus broad cross-neutralization by a monoclonal antibody.
PG  - 303-14
LID - 10.1016/j.str.2012.01.001 [doi]
AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) complex is composed of four distinct but serologically 
      related flaviviruses, which together cause the present-day most important emerging 
      viral disease. Although DENV infection induces lifelong immunity against viruses of 
      the same serotype, the antibodies raised appear to contribute to severe disease in 
      cases of heterotypic infections. Understanding the mechanisms of DENV neutralization 
      by antibodies is, therefore, crucial for the design of vaccines that simultaneously 
      protect against all four viruses. Here, we report a comparative, high-resolution 
      crystallographic analysis of an "A-strand" murine monoclonal antibody, Mab 4E11, in 
      complex with its target domain of the envelope protein from the four DENVs. Mab 4E11 
      is capable of neutralizing all four serotypes, and our study reveals the 
      determinants of this cross-reactivity. The structures also highlight the mechanism 
      by which A-strand Mabs disrupt the architecture of the mature virion, inducing 
      premature fusion loop exposure and concomitant particle inactivation.

PG  - 346-56
LID - 10.1016/j.virol.2011.10.025 [doi]
AB  - RNA replication of dengue virus (DENV) requires an RNA-RNA mediated circularization 
      of the viral genome, which includes at least three sets of complementary RNA 
      sequences on both ends of the genome. The 5' and the 3' untranslated regions form 
      several additional RNA elements that are involved in regulation of translation and 
      required for RNA replication. Communication between the genomic termini results in a 
      structural reorganization of the RNA elements, forming a functional RNA panhandle 
      structure. Here we report that the sequence composition downstream of the 5' CS 
      element in the capsid gene, designated as downstream CS (dCS) sequence - but not the 
      capsid protein - also influences the ability of the viral genome to circularize and 
      hence replicate by modulating the topology of the 5' end. These results provide 
      insights for the design of reporter sub-genomic and genomic mosquito-borne 
      flavivirus constructs and contribute to the understanding of viral RNA replication.

AB  - Dengue is the most important mosquito transmitted viral disease of humans worldwide. 
      Despite intensive study over several decades, many of the fine details of the dengue 
      virus (DENV) replication cycle remain unknown, although generally more is known 
      about the phase of the replication cycle in mammalian cells as compared to the phase 
      in mosquito cells. This results from a combination of less research emphasis on the 
      mosquito stage, as well as fewer tools such as specific antibodies against mosquito 
      proteins and insect informatics databases. The binding of a virus to a host cell is 
      a first and critical stage in the infectious process and the mechanism and identity 
      of cellular proteins involved in this process remains largely unknown. This short 
      review aims to provide an update on our current understanding of the proteins 
      expressed by mosquito cells that mediate DENV binding as a prerequisite to DENV 
      entry and replication.

TI  - Development of Dengue type-2 virus replicons expressing GFP reporter gene in study 
      of viral RNA replication.

LID - 10.1016/j.virusres.2011.12.007 [doi]
AB  - Insertion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) encoding-gene into virus genes has 
      provided a valuable tool for flavivirus research. This study aimed to develop dengue 
      virus (DENV) replicons expressing GFP reporter that would provide a fast in vitro 
      system to analyze functional roles of specific DENV sequences in viral replication. 
      Two classes of recombinant replicon constructs were generated; one was a 
      RNA-launched replicon with a GFP gene directly inserted into a full-length DENV 
      genome (FL-DENV/GFP), and the other consisted of 4 types of DNA-launched DENV 
      subgenomic replicons with GFP replacement at various structural genes (Δ-DENV/GFP). 
      The FL-DENV/GFP resulted in GFP expression in transfected cells with no viable DENV 
      being recovered from the transfection. The Δ-DENV/GFP constructs with partial 
      structural gene deletion (ΔC-, ΔCprM/M-, ΔprM/M-, or ΔE-) expressed bright and long 
      lasting GFP. The GFP expression intensity in living cells correlated well with the 
      level of RNA replication. Various mutations in the 5'noncoding region of DENV-2 
      previously shown to be important genetic determinants for virus replication and 
      mouse virulence were incorporated into the 5 different replicon constructs. 
      Characterizations of 29 mutants demonstrated that these replicons can provide a 
      useful platform for a quick and powerful in vitro system to analyze genetic 
      determinants of DENV replication. These constructs can also be useful for 
      development of vectors expressing foreign genes for various researches.

TI  - Biflavonoids of Dacrydium balansae with potent inhibitory activity on dengue 2 NS5 
      polymerase.
PG  - 672-7
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1298355 [doi]
AB  - In order to find new molecules for antiviral drug design, we screened 102 ethyl 
      acetate extracts from New-Caledonian flora for antiviral activity against the dengue 
      2 virus RNA-dependant RNA polymerase (DV-NS5 RdRp). The leaf extract of Dacrydium 
      balansae, which strongly inhibited the DV-NS5, was submitted to bioguided 
      fractionation. Four biflavonoids ( 1- 4), three sterols ( 5- 7), and two stilbene 
      derivatives ( 8- 9) were identified and evaluated for their antiviral potential on 
      the DV-NS5 RdRp. Biflavonoids appeared to be potent inhibitors of DV-NS5 RdRp with 
      IC (50)s between 0.26 and 3.12 µM. Inhibitory activity evaluations against the RNA 
      polymerase from other Flaviviridae viruses allowed us to conclude that these 
      compounds are specific inhibitors of the DV RNA polymerase. The strongest 
      inhibitions were observed with hinokiflavone ( 4), but podocarpusflavone A ( 2) is 
      the strongest noncytotoxic inhibitor of the DV-NS5 and it also displayed polymerase 
      inhibitory activity in a DV replicon. A preliminary structure-activity relationship 
      study (SARs) revealed the necessity of the biflavonoid skeleton, the influence of 
      number and position of methoxylations, and the importance of a free rotation of the 
      linkage between the two apigenin monomers of the biflavonoids. To the best of our 
      knowledge, podocarpusflavone A ( 2) is the strongest noncytotoxic non-nucleotide 
      molecule exhibiting a specific inhibitory activity against the RNA polymerase domain 
      of DV-NS5 and thus is promising for chemotherapy development against dengue fever.

TI  - Simple Prognostic Criteria can Definitively Identify Patients who Develop Severe 
      Versus Non-Severe Dengue Disease, or Have Other Febrile Illnesses.
PG  - 33-44

AB  - BACKGROUND: SEVERE DENGUE DISEASE (SDD) (DHF/DSS: dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue 
      shock syndrome) results from either primary or secondary dengue virus (DENV) 
      infections, which occur 4 - 6 days after the onset of fever. As yet, there are no 
      definitive clinical or hematological criteria that can specifically identify SDD 
      patients during the early acute febrile-phase of disease (day 0 - 3: < 72 hours). 
      This study was performed during a SDD (DHF/DSS) epidemic to: 1) identify the DENV 
      serotypes that caused SDD during primary or secondary DENV infections; 2) identify 
      simple clinical and hematological criteria that could significantly discriminate 
      between patients who subsequently developed SDD versus non-SDD (N-SDD), or had a 
      non-DENV fever of unknown origin (FUO) during day 0 - 3 of fever; 3) assess whether 
      DENV serotype co-infections resulted in SDD. METHODS: First serum samples, with 
      clinical and hematological criteria, were collected from 100 patients during the 
      early acute febrile-phase (day 0 - 3: < 72 hours), assessed for DENV or FUO 
      infections by IgM- and IgG-capture ELISAs on paired serum samples and by DENV 
      isolations, and subsequently graded as SDD, N-SDD or FUO patients. RESULTS: IN THIS 
      STUDY: 1) Thirty-three patients had DENV infections, predominantly secondary DENV-2 
      infections, including each SDD (DHF/DSS) case; 2) Secondary DENV-2/-3 and DENV-2/-4 
      serotype co-infections however resulted in N-SDD; 3) Each patient who subsequently 
      developed SDD, but none of the others, displayed three clinical criteria: abdominal 
      pain, conjunctival injection and veni-puncture bleeding, therefore each of these 
      criteria provided definitively significant prognostic (P < 0.001) values; 4) 
      Petechia, positive tourniquet tests and hepatomegaly, and neutrophilia or leukopenia 
      also significantly identified those who: a) subsequently developed SDD versus N-SDD, 
      or had a FUO; b) subsequently developed SDD versus N-SDD; c) subsequently developed 
      N-SDD versus FUOs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of simple 
      definitively prognostic criteria for SDD patients, including the first assessment 
      and confirmation of conjunctival injection. The three definitive clinical criteria 
      used alone, or supported by the other four criteria, could be essential for 
      specifically identifying those patients needing prompt hospital-based therapies to 
      lessen or avert SDD, without unnecessary hospitalization of the other patients.

TI  - HLA-A*0201-restricted CD8+ T-cell epitopes identified in dengue viruses.
PG  - 259
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-9-259 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: All four dengue virus (DV) serotypes (D1V, D2V, D3V and D4V) can cause a 
      series of disorders, ranging from mild dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Previous studies have 
      revealed that DV serotype-specific CD8(+) T cells are involved in controlling DV 
      infection. Serotype cross-reactive CD8(+) T-cells may contribute to the 
      immunopathogenesis of DHF/DSS. The aim of the study was to identify 
      HLA-A*0201-binding peptides from four DV serotypes. We then examined their 
      immunogenicity in vivo and cross-reactivity within heterologous peptides. METHODS: 
      D1V-derived candidate CD8(+) T-cell epitopes were synthesized and evaluated for 
      their affinity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule. Variant peptides representing 
      heterologous D2V, D3V, D4V serotypes were synthesized. The immunogenicity of the 
      high-affinity peptides were evaluated in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice. RESULTS: Of the 
      seven D1V-derived candidate epitopes [D1V-NS4a(56-64)(MLLALIAVL), 
      D1V-C(46-54)(LVMAFMAFL), D1V-NS4b(562-570)(LLATSIFKL), D1V-NS2a(169-177)(AMVLSIVSL), 
      D1V-NS4a(140-148)(GLLFMILTV), D1V-NS2a(144-152)(QLWAALLSL) and 
      D1V-NS4b(183-191)(LLMRTTWAL)], three peptides [D1V-NS4a(140-148), D1V-NS2a(144-152) 
      and D1V-NS4b(183-191)] had a high affinity for HLA-A*0201 molecules. Moreover, their 
      variant peptides for D2V, D3V and D4V [D2V-NS4a(140-148)(AILTVVAAT), 
      D3V-NS4a(140-148)(GILTLAAIV), D4V-NS4a(140-148)(TILTIIGLI), 
      D2V-NS2a(144-152)(QLAVTIMAI), D3V-NS2a(144-152)(QLWTALVSL), 
      D4V-NS2a(143-151)(QVGTLALSL), D2V-NS4b(182-190)(LMMRTTWAL), D3V-NS4b(182-190) 
      (LLMRTSWAL) and D4V-NS4b(179-187)(LLMRTTWAF)] also had a high affinity for 
      HLA-A*0201 molecules. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells directed to these twelve peptides 
      were induced in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice following immunization with these 
      peptides. Additionally, cross-reactivity within four peptides (D1V-NS4b(183-191), 
      D2V-NS4b(182-190), D3V-NS4b(182-190) and D4V-NS4b(179-187)) was observed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Two novel serotype-specific HLA-A*0201-restricted CD8(+) T-cell 
      epitopes (NS4a(140-148) and NS2a(144-152)) and one cross-reactive 
      HLA-A*0201-restricted CD8(+) T-cell epitopes which is similar to a previously 
      identified epitope were identified in D1V-D4V. Combining prediction algorithms and 
      HLA transgenic mice is an effective strategy to identify HLA-restricted epitopes. 
      Serotype-specific epitopes would be used to determine the protective role of 
      serotype-specific CD8(+) T cells, while cross-reactive epitopes may provide 
      assistance in exploring the role of serotype cross-reactive CD8(+) T cells in the 
      immunopathogenesis of DHF/DSS.

TI  - Presence of entomobirnaviruses in Chinese mosquitoes in the absence of Dengue virus 
      co-infection.

LID - 10.1099/vir.0.048231-0 [doi]
AB  - Birnaviruses, including the genus Entomobirnavirus, are socio-economically important 
      viruses. Currently, only Drosophila X virus has been formally assigned to the genus 
      Entomobirnavirus, but two more viruses were recently isolated, Espirito Santo virus 
      (ESV) and Culex Y virus. The host mosquito has been reported to carry many viruses, 
      but seldom entomobirnaviruses. To discover potential pathogens in mosquitoes, we 
      exploited small-RNAs high-throughput sequencing of three mosquito species caught in 
      South China. A virus that genetically likes entomobirnavirus, Mosquito X virus 
      (MXV), was identified from Anopheles sinensis and was 97% identical to ESV, which 
      co-infects with Dengue virus (DENV). However, the absence of DENV in the A. sinensis 
      suggested the independence of MXV infection from dengue co-infection. Our discovery 
      complements prior research on entomobirnaviruses and proved that MXV may be 
      widespread in mosquitoes on different continents. This work also highlights the 
      applying of high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs to survey viruses carried by 
      insect vectors.

AB  - Currently assembling genomes without reference is one of the most important 
      challenges for bioinformaticists all over the world in an attempt to characterize 
      new organisms. The current study has used two dengue virus type 4 (DENV-4) strains 
      recently isolated in Brazil, which have its genomes sequenced using the GSFLX 454 
      sequencer (Roche, Life Science) by the pyrosequencing method. The GSFLX 454 data 
      were used for testing different genome assembling strategies. We described a 
      pipeline that was able to recover more than 96% of the sequenced genome in a single 
      run and could be helpful for further assembly attempts of other DENV genomes, as 
      well as other RNA virus-like genomes.

PG  - e1002912

LID - e1002912
AB  - The dengue virus (DV) is an important human pathogen from the Flavivirus genus, 
      whose genome- and antigenome RNAs start with the strictly conserved sequence pppAG. 
      The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a product of the NS5 gene, initiates RNA 
      synthesis de novo, i.e., without the use of a pre-existing primer. Very little is 
      known about the mechanism of this de novo initiation and how conservation of the 
      starting adenosine is achieved. The polymerase domain NS5Pol(DV) of NS5, upon 
      initiation on viral RNA templates, synthesizes mainly dinucleotide primers that are 
      then elongated in a processive manner. We show here that NS5Pol(DV) contains a 
      specific priming site for adenosine 5'-triphosphate as the first transcribed 
      nucleotide. Remarkably, in the absence of any RNA template the enzyme is able to 
      selectively synthesize the dinucleotide pppAG when Mn(2+) is present as catalytic 
      ion. The T794 to A799 priming loop is essential for initiation and provides at least 
      part of the ATP-specific priming site. The H798 loop residue is of central 
      importance for the ATP-specific initiation step. In addition to ATP selection, 
      NS5Pol(DV) ensures the conservation of the 5'-adenosine by strongly discriminating 
      against viral templates containing an erroneous 3'-end nucleotide in the presence of 
      Mg(2+). In the presence of Mn(2+), NS5Pol(DV) is remarkably able to generate and 
      elongate the correct pppAG primer on these erroneous templates. This can be regarded 
      as a genomic/antigenomic RNA end repair mechanism. These conservational mechanisms, 
      mediated by the polymerase alone, may extend to other RNA virus families having 
      RdRps initiating RNA synthesis de novo.

AB  - To determine the cardiovascular changes in children with dengue shock syndrome. 
      Echocardiography was performed in 8 children (5 females) with dengue shock syndrome, 
      median age 6.5, 4.2-13.7 yr and weight 34, 12-66 kg. All had massive bleeding with 
      low initial hematocrit in most cases (median 31%), thrombocytopenia (median platelet 
      37,000/μL), and coagulopathy with massive pleural effusion. Seven (87.5%) developed 
      acute renal failure and hepatic failure. All patients were in either compensate or 
      decompensate shock with alteration of consciousness, tachycardia, poor tissue 
      perfusion, and prolonged capillary refill (>4 s) with mean arterial pressure 65, 
      39-94 mm Hg. The cardiac dimension was normal to low normal except one had dilated 
      left ventricle. Seven patients had normal left ventricular systolic function (5 with 
      inotrope infusion). One patient had impaired systolic function even with inotrope. 
      All had normal cardiac index (4.14, 3.51-6.37 L/min/m(2)) with increased heart rate 
      (141.5, 110-160/min) but low stroke volume index (30.72, 25.37-42.49 mL/m(2)) and 
      low systemic vascular resistance index (1,072, 223-2,880 dyne/sec/cm(-5)/m(2)). 
      Decreased preload from bleeding and vascular leakage into the third space play an 
      important role in shock in Dengue. However, decreased stroke volume and low systemic 
      vascular resistance may be additional causes of shock.

AB  - The Faradaic electrochemical impedance technique is employed to characterize the 
      impedance change of a nanoporous alumina biosensor in response towards the specific 
      binding of dengue serotype 2 (Denv2) viral particles to its serotype 2-specific 
      immunoglobulin G antibody within the thin alumina layer. The optimal equivalent 
      circuit model that matches the impedimetric responses of the sensor describes three 
      distinct regions: the electrolyte solution (R(s)), the porous alumina channels 
      (including biomaterials) (Q(1), R(1)) and the conductive electrode substrate layer 
      (Q(2), R(2)). Both channel resistance R(1) and capacitance Q(1) change in response 
      to the increase of the Denv2 virus concentration. A linear relationship between R(1) 
      and Denv2 concentration from 1 to 900 plaque forming unit per mL (pfu mL(-1)) can be 
      derived using Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm model. At 1pfu mL(-1) Denv2 
      concentration, R(1) can be distinguished from that of the cell culture control 
      sample. Moreover, Q(1) doubles when Denv2 is added but remains unchanged in the 
      presence of two other non-specific viruses - West Nile virus and Chikungunya virus 
      indicates biosensor specificity can be quantitatively measured using channel 
      capacitance.

TI  - Acute kidney injury in dengue virus infection.
PG  - 390-4
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfs117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a growing public health problem in Pakistan and acute kidney 
      injury (AKI) is one of the least studied complications of dengue virus infection 
      (DVI). The aim of this study was to determine the frequency, severity and predictors 
      of AKI in patients with DVI and to study the impact of AKI on the length of hospital 
      stay and mortality. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients 
      aged ≥14 years hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of DVI at Aga Khan University 
      Hospital Karachi between January 2008 and December 2010. Binary logistic regression 
      models were constructed to identify factors associated with the development of AKI 
      and to study the impact of AKI on hospital stays of more than 3 days. RESULTS: Out 
      of 532 patients, AKI was present in 13.3% (71/532). Approximately two-thirds (64.8%) 
      of these patients had mild AKI and a third (35.2%) had moderate to severe AKI. 
      Independent predictors for AKI were male gender [odds ratio (OD) 4.43; 95% CI 
      1.92-10.23], presence of dengue hemorrhagic and dengue shock syndrome (DSS, OD 2.14; 
      95% CI 1.06-4.32), neurological involvement (OD 12.08; 95% CI 2.82-51.77) and 
      prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT, OD 1.81; 95% CI 1.003-3.26). 
      AKI was associated with a length of stay ≥3 days when compared with those who did 
      not have AKI (OD 2.98; 95% CI 1.66-5.34). Eight patients (11.3%) with AKI died 
      whereas there were no mortalities in patients without AKI (P < 0.001). Only 5 
      patients (7%) had persistent kidney dysfunction at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: AKI in 
      DVI is associated with neurological involvement, prolongation of aPTT, greater 
      length of hospital stay and increased mortality.

TI  - Transplantation of a hydrogen bonding network from West Nile virus protease onto 
      Dengue-2 protease improves catalytic efficiency and sheds light on substrate 
      specificity.
PG  - 843-50

AB  - The two-component serine protease of flaviviruses such as Dengue virus (DENV) and 
      West Nile virus (WNV) are attractive targets for inhibitor/therapeutic design. 
      Peptide aldehyde inhibitors that bind to the covalently tethered two-component WNV 
      protease (WNVpro) with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) at sub-micromolar 
      concentrations, bind the equivalent DENV-2 protease (DEN2pro) with IC(50) of 
      micromolar concentrations at best. Conversely, the protease inhibitor aprotinin 
      binds DEN2pro ∼1000-fold more tightly than WNVpro. To investigate the residues that 
      are crucial for binding specificity differences, a binding-site network of hydrogen 
      bonds was transplanted from WNVpro onto DEN2pro. The transplantations were a 
      combination of single, double and triple mutations involving S79D, S83N and S85Q. 
      The mutant DENV proteases, except those involving S85Q, proved to be more efficient 
      enzymes, as measured by their kinetic parameters. The binding affinities of the 
      mutants to peptide inhibitors however showed only marginal improvement. Protein 
      structure modeling suggests that the negatively charged residue cluster, 
      Glu89-Glu92, of the NS2B cofactor may play an important role in determining 
      substrate/inhibitor-binding specificity. These same residues may also explain why 
      aprotinin binds more tightly to DEN2pro than WNVpro. Our results suggest that 
      structure-based inhibitor design experiments need to explicitly consider/include 
      this C-terminal region whose negative charge is conserved across the four DENV 
      serotypes and also among the flavivirus family of proteases.

      microscopy and single-particle analysis.
PG  - 771-779
LID - 10.1099/vir.0.039321-0 [doi]
AB  - The flavivirus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a glycoprotein that is secreted as 
      a soluble hexameric complex during the course of natural infection. Growing evidence 
      indicates that this secreted form of NS1 (sNS1) plays a significant role in immune 
      evasion and modulation during infection. Attempts to determine the crystal structure 
      of NS1 have been unsuccessful to date and relatively little is known about the 
      macromolecular organization of the sNS1 hexamer. Here, we have applied 
      single-particle analysis to images of baculovirus-derived recombinant dengue 2 virus 
      NS1 obtained by electron microscopy to determine its 3D structure to a resolution of 
      23 Å. This structure reveals a barrel-like organization of the three dimeric units 
      that comprise the hexamer and provides further insights into the overall 
      organization of oligomeric sNS1.

PG  - 902-9
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.12-0244 [doi]
AB  - México has cities (e.g., México City and Puebla City) located at elevations > 2,000 
      m and above the elevation ceiling below which local climates allow the dengue virus 
      mosquito vector Aedes aegypti to proliferate. Climate warming could raise this 
      ceiling and place high-elevation cities at risk for dengue virus transmission. To 
      assess the elevation ceiling for Ae. aegypti and determine the potential for using 
      weather/climate parameters to predict mosquito abundance, we surveyed 12 communities 
      along an elevation/climate gradient from Veracruz City (sea level) to Puebla City 
      (∼2,100 m). Ae. aegypti was commonly encountered up to 1,700 m and present but rare 
      from 1,700 to 2,130 m. This finding extends the known elevation range in México by > 
      300 m. Mosquito abundance was correlated with weather parameters, including 
      temperature indices. Potential larval development sites were abundant in Puebla City 
      and other high-elevation communities, suggesting that Ae. aegypti could proliferate 
      should the climate become warmer.

TI  - A novel coding-region RNA element modulates infectious dengue virus particle 
      production in both mammalian and mosquito cells and regulates viral replication in 
      Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
PG  - 511-26
LID - 10.1016/j.virol.2012.06.028 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped flavivirus with a positive-sense RNA genome 
      transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, causing the most important arthropod-borne viral 
      disease affecting humans. Relatively few cis-acting RNA regulatory elements have 
      been described in the DENV coding-region. Here, by introducing silent mutations into 
      a DENV-2 infectious clone, we identify the conserved capsid-coding region 1 (CCR1), 
      an RNA sequence element that regulates viral replication in mammalian cells and to a 
      greater extent in Ae. albopictus mosquito cells. These defects were confirmed in 
      vivo, resulting in decreased replication in Ae. aegypti mosquito bodies and 
      dissemination to the salivary glands. Furthermore, CCR1 does not regulate 
      translation, RNA synthesis or virion retention but likely modulates assembly, as 
      mutations resulted in the release of non-infectious viral particles from both cell 
      types. Understanding the role of CCR1 could help characterize the poorly-defined 
      stage of assembly in the DENV life cycle and uncover novel anti-viral targets.

      against dengue virus.
PG  - 767-79
LID - 10.1038/emboj.2011.439 [doi]
AB  - The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to -4) cause the most important emerging 
      viral disease. Protein E, the principal viral envelope glycoprotein, mediates fusion 
      of the viral and endosomal membranes during virus entry and is the target of 
      neutralizing antibodies. However, the epitopes of strongly neutralizing human 
      antibodies have not been described despite their importance to vaccine development. 
      The chimpanzee Mab 5H2 potently neutralizes DENV-4 by binding to domain I of E. The 
      crystal structure of Fab 5H2 bound to E from DENV-4 shows that antibody binding 
      prevents formation of the fusogenic hairpin conformation of E, which together with 
      in-vitro assays, demonstrates that 5H2 neutralizes by blocking membrane fusion in 
      the endosome. Furthermore, we show that human sera from patients recovering from 
      DENV-4 infection contain antibodies that bind to the 5H2 epitope region on domain I. 
      This study, thus, provides new information and tools for effective vaccine design to 
      prevent dengue disease.

AB  - Diverse classes of sulfated polysaccharides obtained from the red seaweeds

      seaweeds (Phaeophyta) Stoechospermum marginatum and Cystoseira indica and the green 
      seaweed (Chlorophyta) Caulerpa racemosa were assayed for antiviral activity against 
      the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). DENV-2 was the most susceptible serotype 
      to all polysulfates, with inhibitory concentration 50% values in the range 0.12-20 
      μg/mL. The antiviral potency of the sulfated polysaccharides depended on the sulfate 
      content, the position of sulfate group, the sugar composition, and the molar mass. 
      Independently of the sugar composition, the antiviral effect was mainly exerted 
      during DENV-2 adsorption and internalization.

AB  - We have developed a robust cytopathic effect-based high-throughput screening assay 
      to identify inhibitors of dengue virus (DENV) infection. Screening of a small 
      natural product library yielded 11 hits. Four of these were found to be potent 
      inhibitors of DENV, although serotype differences were noted. Taken together, these 
      data suggest that screening of larger and more complex molecule libraries may result 
      in the identification of more potent and specific DENV inhibitors.

TI  - Epitope reactions can be gauged by relative antibody discriminating specificity 
      (RADS) values supported by deletion, substitution and cysteine bridge formation 
      analyses: potential uses in pathogenesis studies.
PG  - 208
LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-5-208 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epitope-mapping of infectious agents is essential for pathogenesis 
      studies. Since polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are 
      always polyspecific and can react with multiple epitopes, it is important to 
      distinguish between specific and non-specific reactions. Relative antibody 
      discriminating specificity (RADS) values, obtained from their relative ELISA 
      reactions with L-amino acid peptides prepared in the natural versus reverse 
      orientations (x-fold absorbance natural/absorbance reverse = RADS value) may be 
      valuable for this purpose.PAbs generated against the dengue type-2 virus (DENV-2) 
      nonstructural-1 (NS1) glycoprotein candidate vaccine also reacted with both DENV 
      envelope (E) glycoproteins and blood-clotting proteins. New xKGSx/xSGKx amino acid 
      motifs were identified on DENV-2 glycoproteins, HIV-1 gp41 and factor IXa. Their 
      potential roles in DENV and HIV-1 antibody-enhanced replication (AER) and 
      auto-immunity were assessed.In this study, a) RADS values were determined for MAbs 
      and PAbs, generated in congeneic (H2: class II) mice against DENV NS1 glycoprotein 
      epitopes, to account for their cross-reaction patterns, and b) MAb 1G5.3 reactions 
      with xKGSx/xSGKx motifs present in the DENV-4 NS1, E and HIV-1 glycoproteins and 
      factor IXa were assessed after the introduction of amino acid substitutions, 
      deletions, or intra-/inter-cysteine (C-C) bridges. RESULTS: MAbs 1H7.4, 5H4.3, 3D1.4 
      and 1G5.3 had high (4.23- to 16.83-fold) RADS values against single epitopes on the 
      DENV-2 NS1 glycoprotein, and MAb 3D1.4 defined the DENV complex-conserved LX1 
      epitope. In contrast, MAbs 1G5.4-A1-C3 and 1C6.3 had low (0.47- to 1.67-fold) RADS 
      values against multiple epitopes. PAb DENV complex-reactions occurred through 
      moderately-high (2.77- and 3.11-fold) RADS values against the LX1 epitope. MAb 1G5.3 
      reacted with xSGKx motifs present in DENV-4 NS1 and E glycoproteins, HIV-1 gp41 and 
      factor IXa, while natural C-C bridge formations or certain amino acid substitutions 
      increased its binding activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results: i) were readily obtained 
      using a standard 96-well ELISA format, ii) showed the LX1 epitope to be the 
      immuno-dominant DENV complex determinant in the NS1 glycoprotein, iii) supported an 
      antigenic co-evolution of the DENV NS1 and E glycoproteins, and iv) identified 
      methods that made it possible to determine the role of anti-DENV PAb reactions in 
      viral pathogenesis.

AB  - Infection with dengue virus presents a broad clinical spectrum, which can range from 
      asymptomatic cases to severe cases that are characterised by haemorrhagic syndrome 
      and/or shock. The reason for such variability remains unknown. This work evaluated 
      the in vitro permissiveness of mouse, rat, hamster and guinea pig macrophages to 
      infection by dengue virus 2 (DENV2). The results established that macrophages 
      derived from the BALB/c mouse strain showed higher permissiveness to DENV2 infection 
      than macrophages from other rodent species, although all rodent species studied had 
      the C820T mutation in the oligoadenylate synthetase 1b gene, indicating no 
      relationship to the different in vitro susceptibilities of mouse cells at this 
      locus. Other molecular mechanisms related to flavivirus susceptibility remain to be 
      explored.

AB  - The dengue virus membrane (M) protein is a key component of the mature virion. Here, 
      we characterised the cellular behaviour of M using a recombinant protein construct 
      to understand its inherent properties. Using confocal microscopy, we showed that M 
      and its intracellular precursor, prM, localised to the endoplasmic reticulum. M 
      protein was also detected on the cell surface and secreted, suggesting that M can 
      enter the secretory pathway. In addition, cross-linking studies showed that M can 
      form dimers and tetramers. These findings suggest that M behaves as a secretory 
      protein analogous to the major envelope protein E.

AB  - The envelope (E) protein is composed of three domains (ED1, ED2 and ED3) with ED3 
      targeted by the most potent neutralizing antibodies. DENV-2 strains can be divided 
      into six genotypes. Comparison of ED3 of representative strains of the six genotypes 
      revealed that there are nine variable residues that are specific to a given 
      genotype. Recombinant ED3s (rED3s) of six different DENV-2 strains representing all 
      nine variable residues were expressed, and their reactivity against a panel of two 
      DENV-2 type-specific and three DENV complex-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
      were compared. The differences in binding affinity to the rED3s representing 
      different DENV-2 genotypes were relatively small, with the exception of 
      type-specific-mAb 3H5 that showed up to 10-fold differences in binding between 
      genotypes. Overall the binding differences did not lead to detectable differences in 
      neutralization. Based on these results, DENV-2 ED3-specific neutralizing antibodies 
      will likely be effective against DENV-2 strains from all six genotypes.

TI  - NS4A and NS4B proteins from dengue virus: membranotropic regions.
PG  - 2818-30
LID - 10.1016/j.bbamem.2012.06.022 [doi]
AB  - Proteins NS4A and NS4B from Dengue Virus (DENV) are highly hydrophobic transmembrane 
      proteins which are responsible, at least in part, for the membrane arrangements 
      leading to the formation of the viral replication complex, essential for the viral 
      life cycle. In this work we have identified the membranotropic regions of DENV NS4A 
      and NS4B proteins by performing an exhaustive study of membrane rupture induced by 
      NS4A and NS4B peptide libraries on simple and complex model membranes as well as 
      their ability to modulate the phospholipid phase transitions P(β')-L(α) of DMPC and 
      L(β)-L(α)/L(α)-H(II) of DEPE. Protein NS4A presents three membrane active regions 
      coincident with putative transmembrane segments, whereas NS4B presented up to nine 
      membrane active regions, four of them presumably putative transmembrane segments. 
      These data recognize the existence of different membrane-active segments on these 
      proteins and support their role in the formation of the replication complex and 
      therefore directly implicated in the DENV life cycle.

TI  - Critical effect of peptide cyclization on the potency of peptide inhibitors against 
      Dengue virus NS2B-NS3 protease.
PG  - 6881-7
LID - 10.1021/jm300655h [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a serious public health threat worldwide that 
      demands effective treatment. In the search for potent virus protease inhibitors, 
      several cone snail venoms were screened against serotype 2 DENV NS2B-NS3 protease, 
      and one conotoxin, MrIA, was identified to have inhibitory activity. The inhibitory 
      activity was attributed to a disulfide bond-mediated loop, from which rational 
      optimization was made to improve the potency and stability. An eight-residue cyclic 
      peptide inhibitor was finally obtained with high potency (inhibitory constant 2.2 
      μM), stability, and cell permeability. This inhibitor can thus serve as a good lead 
      for DENV drug development. In addition, this work highlights the critical effect of 
      peptide cyclization on the potency of oligopeptide inhibitors against DENV protease, 
      which may advance the design of peptide inhibitors for homologous virus proteases.

AB  - Timely and extensive space spraying has been widely used to prevent the spread of 
      dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF). Field evaluations on its 
      effectiveness have been rarely reported. This study aimed to evaluate the 
      timeliness, coverage, and effectiveness of space spraying for DF/DHF control using a 
      geographic information system (GIS). Longitudinal monitoring of DF/DHF cases and 
      spray activities in Songkhla municipality was done between May 2006 and April 2007. 
      After a case was detected, subsequent cases occurring within a 100 meter radius of 
      the index case's house and between 16-35 days of onset were considered as potential 
      secondary cases. During the study period, 140 cases of DF/DHF were detected. Of 
      these, 25 were identified as secondary infections from 20 index cases. Where a 
      secondary infection occurred, the mean attack rate was 2.7 per 1,000 population. Two 
      significant predictors for being a secondary case were both related to the house of 
      the index case, namely, absence of window screens and being constructed with 
      corrugated iron sheets. Our findings suggest that space spraying in the study area 
      was inadequate and often failed to prevent secondary cases of DF/DHF. Control 
      programs should target houses constructed with corrugated iron sheets.

PG  - 137-9
LID - 10.1007/s12104-012-9395-9 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus, belongs to Flaviviridae, is an arthropod transmitted virus that 
      threatens millions of people's lives. As with other flaviviruses, a positive 
      single-stranded 11-kilobases RNA in the dengue virus genome encodes three structural 
      proteins (capsid protein C, membrane protein M, and envelope protein E) and seven 
      non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). The two 
      component protease NS2B-NS3p is essential for viral replication and is believed to 
      be a potential antiviral drug target. Aprotinin, a native inhibitor, is proved to 
      retard the activity of NS2B-NS3p. The backbone assignments of NS2B-NS3p will be 
      essential for determining the high resolution solution structure of NS2B-NS3p and 
      screening new antiviral drugs. Herein, we report the backbone (1)H, (15)N, (13)C 
      resonance assignments of the N terminal fragment of NS2B (4.8 kDa) and NS3p (18.5 
      kDa) in complex with aprotinin (6.5 kDa) by high resolution NMR.

TI  - Mutagenesis of the DI/DIII linker in dengue virus envelope protein impairs viral 
      particle assembly.
PG  - 7072-83
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00224-12 [doi]
AB  - The dengue virus (DV) envelope (E) protein is important in mediating viral entry and 
      assembly of progeny virus during cellular infection. Domains I and III (DI and DIII, 
      respectively) of the DV E protein are connected by a highly conserved but poorly 
      ordered region, the DI/DIII linker. Although the flexibility of the DI/DIII linker 
      is thought to be important for accommodating the structural rearrangements undergone 
      by the E protein during viral entry, the function of the linker in the DV infectious 
      cycle is not well understood. In this study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis 
      on conserved residues in the DI/DIII linker of the DV2 E protein and showed that the 
      resulting mutations had little or no effect on the entry process but greatly 
      affected virus assembly. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy 
      experiments performed on infectious virus as well as in a virus-like particle (VLP) 
      system indicate that the DI/DIII linker mutants express the DV structural proteins 
      at the sites of particle assembly near the ER but fail to form infectious particles. 
      This defect is not due to disruption of E's interaction with prM and pr in immature 
      and mature virions, respectively. Serial passaging of the DV2 mutant E-Y299F led to 
      the identification of a mutation in the membrane-proximal stem region of E that 
      fully compensates for the assembly defect of this DI/DIII linker mutant. Together, 
      our results suggest a critical and previously unidentified role for the E protein 
      DI/DIII linker region during the DV2 assembly process.

TI  - Antiviral protection and the importance of Wolbachia density and tissue tropism in 
      Drosophila simulans.
PG  - 6922-9
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01727-12 [doi]
AB  - Wolbachia, a maternally transmitted endosymbiont of insects, is increasingly being 
      seen as an effective biological control agent that can interfere with transmission 
      of pathogens, including dengue virus. However, the mechanism of antiviral protection 
      is not well understood. The density and distribution of Wolbachia in host tissues 
      have been implicated as contributing factors by previous studies with both 
      mosquitoes and flies. Drosophila flies infected with five diverse strains of 
      Wolbachia were screened for the ability to mediate antiviral protection. The three 
      protective Wolbachia strains were more closely related and occurred at a higher 
      density within whole flies than the two nonprotective Wolbachia strains. In this 
      study, to further investigate the relationship between whole-fly Wolbachia density 
      and the ability to mediate antiviral protection, tetracycline was used to decrease 
      the abundance of the high-density, protective Wolbachia strain wAu prior to viral 
      challenge. Antiviral protection was lost when the density of the protective 
      Wolbachia strain was decreased to an abundance similar to that of nonprotective 
      Wolbachia strains. We determined the Wolbachia density and distribution in tissues 
      of the same five fly-Wolbachia combinations as used previously. The Wolbachia 
      density within the head, gut, and Malpighian tubules correlated with the ability to 
      mediate antiviral protection. These findings may facilitate the development of 
      Wolbachia biological control strategies and help to predict host-Wolbachia pairings 
      that may interfere with virus-induced pathology.

TI  - Gene flow networks among American Aedes aegypti populations.
PG  - 664-76
LID - 10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00244.x [doi]
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti, the dengue virus vector, has spread throughout the 
      tropics in historical times. While this suggests man-mediated dispersal, estimating 
      contemporary connectivity among populations has remained elusive. Here, we use a 
      large mtDNA dataset and a Bayesian coalescent framework to test a set of hypotheses 
      about gene flow among American Ae. aegypti populations. We assessed gene flow 
      patterns at the continental and subregional (Amazon basin) scales. For the Americas, 
      our data favor a stepping-stone model in which gene flow is higher among adjacent 
      populations but in which, at the same time, North American and southeastern 
      Brazilian populations are directly connected, likely via sea trade. Within Amazonia, 
      the model with highest support suggests extensive gene flow among major cities; 
      Manaus, located at the center of the subregional transport network, emerges as a 
      potentially important connecting hub. Our results suggest substantial connectivity 
      across Ae. aegypti populations in the Americas. As long-distance active dispersal 
      has not been observed in this species, our data support man-mediated dispersal as a 
      major determinant of the genetic structure of American Ae. aegypti populations. The 
      inferred topology of interpopulation connectivity can inform network models of Ae. 
      aegypti and dengue spread.

TI  - Bioinformatics prediction of siRNAs as potential antiviral agents against dengue 
      viruses.
PG  - 519-22
LID - 10.6026/97320630008519 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV 1-4) represents the major emerging arthropod-borne viral 
      infection in the world. Currently, there is neither an available vaccine nor a 
      specific treatment. Hence, there is a need of antiviral drugs for these viral 
      infections; we describe the prediction of short interfering RNA (siRNA) as potential 
      therapeutic agents against the four DENV serotypes. Our strategy was to carry out a 
      series of multiple alignments using ClustalX program to find conserved sequences 
      among the four DENV serotype genomes to obtain a consensus sequence for siRNAs 
      design. A highly conserved sequence among the four DENV serotypes, located in the 
      encoding sequence for NS4B and NS5 proteins was found. A total of 2,893 complete 
      DENV genomes were downloaded from the NCBI, and after a depuration procedure to 
      identify identical sequences, 220 complete DENV genomes were left. They were edited 
      to select the NS4B and NS5 sequences, which were aligned to obtain a consensus 
      sequence. Three different servers were used for siRNA design, and the resulting 
      siRNAs were aligned to identify the most prevalent sequences. Three siRNAs were 
      chosen, one targeted the genome region that codifies for NS4B protein and the other 
      two; the region for NS5 protein. Predicted secondary structure for DENV genomes was 
      used to demonstrate that the siRNAs were able to target the viral genome forming 
      double stranded structures, necessary to activate the RNA silencing machinery.

TI  - Studies on the ovitraps baited with hay and leaf infusions for the surveillance of 
      dengue vector, Aedes albopictus in northeastern India.
PG  - 598-604
AB  - Ovitraps baited with hay and leaf infusions were evaluated for enhancing the 
      oviposition response of gravid females of the dengue vector Aedes albopictus. The 
      egg density per trap (mean ± SEmean) was the highest with 30% infusions of 
      Pennisetum grass hay (623.6 ± 41) and rice straw (580 ± 51.3), which corresponded to 
      oviposition activity index (OAI) of 0.62. Infusions (5-50%) of mango and banana 
      leaves with OAI ranging from -0.36 to 0.39 were not observed to enhance the 
      oviposition response significantly over control. Rice straw and Pennisetum grass hay 
      are available round the year in northeastern India and the use of these infusions 
      can be a cost effective way to augment the ovitrap surveillance of dengue vectors.

PG  - 2476-81
LID - 10.1002/prot.24146 [doi]
AB  - Dengue remains one of the major public concerns as the virus eludes the immune 
      response. Currently, no vaccines or antiviral therapeutics are available for dengue 
      prevention or treatment. Immunosuppressive drug FK506 shows an antimalarial 
      activity, and its molecular target, FK506-binding protein (FKBP), was identified in 
      human Plasmodium parasites. Likewise, a conserved FKBP family protein has also been 
      identified in Aedes aegypti (AaFKBP12), which is expected to play a similar role in 
      the life cycle of Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue virus infection. As 
      FKBPs belong to a highly conserved class of immunophilin family and are involved in 
      key biological regulations, they are considered as attractive pharmacological 
      targets. In this study, we have determined the nuclear magnetic resonance solution 
      structure of AaFKBP12, a novel FKBP member from Aedes aegypti, and presented its 
      structural features, which may facilitate the design of potential inhibitory ligands 
      against the dengue-transmitting mosquitoes.

TI  - Structure of a dengue virus envelope protein late-stage fusion intermediate.
PG  - 2287-93
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02957-12 [doi]
AB  - The final stages of dengue virus fusion are thought to occur when the 
      membrane-proximal stem drives the transmembrane anchor of the viral envelope protein 
      (E) toward the fusion loop, buried in the target cell membrane. Crystal structures 
      of E have lacked this essential stem region. We expressed and crystallized soluble 
      mutant forms of the dengue virus envelope protein (sE) that include portions of the 
      juxtamembrane stem. Their structures represent late-stage fusion intermediates. The 
      proximal part of the stem has both intra- and intermolecular interactions, so the 
      chain "zips up" along the trimer seam. The penultimate interaction we detected 
      involves the conserved residue F402, which has hydrophobic contacts with a conserved 
      surface on domain II. These interactions do not require any larger-scale changes in 
      trimer packing. The techniques for expression and crystallization of sE containing 
      stem reported here may allow further characterization of the final stages of 
      flavivirus fusion.

TI  - Dengue virus nonstructural protein 5 adopts multiple conformations in solution.
PG  - 5921-31
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is composed of two globular 
      domains separated by a 10-residue linker. The N-terminal domain participates in the 
      synthesis of a mRNA cap 1 structure ((7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)) at the 5' end of the viral 
      genome and possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase, and 
      nucleoside-2'O-methyltransferase activities. The C-terminal domain is an 
      RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for viral RNA synthesis. Although crystal 
      structures of the two isolated domains have been obtained, there are no structural 
      data for full-length NS5. It is also unclear whether the two NS5 domains interact 
      with each other to form a stable structure in which the relative orientation of the 
      two domains is fixed. To investigate the structure and dynamics of DENV type 3 NS5 
      in solution, we conducted small-angle X-ray scattering experiments with the 
      full-length protein. NS5 was found to be monomeric and well-folded under the 
      conditions tested. The results of these experiments also suggest that NS5 adopts 
      multiple conformations in solution, ranging from compact to more extended forms in 
      which the two domains do not seem to interact with each other. We interpret the 
      multiple conformations of NS5 observed in solution as resulting from weak 
      interactions between the two NS5 domains and flexibility of the linker in the 
      absence of other components of the replication complex.

AB  - Flavivirus envelope protein (E) mediates membrane fusion and viral entry from 
      endosomes. A low-pH induced, dimer-to-trimer rearrangement and reconfiguration of 
      the membrane-proximal "stem" of the E ectodomain draw together the viral and 
      cellular membranes. We found stem-derived peptides from dengue virus (DV) bind 
      stem-less E trimer and mimic the stem-reconfiguration step in the fusion pathway. We 
      adapted this experiment as a high-throughput screen for small molecules that block 
      peptide binding and thus may inhibit viral entry. A compound identified in this 
      screen, 1662G07, and a number of its analogs reversibly inhibit DV infectivity. They 
      do so by binding the prefusion, dimeric E on the virion surface, before adsorption 
      to a cell. They also block viral fusion with liposomes. Structure-activity 
      relationship studies have led to analogs with submicromolar IC₉₀s against DV2, and 
      certain analogs are active against DV serotypes 1,2, and 4. The compounds do not 
      inhibit the closely related Kunjin virus. We propose that they bind in a previously 
      identified, E-protein pocket, exposed on the virion surface and although this pocket 
      is closed in the postfusion trimer, its mouth is fully accessible. Examination of 
      the E-trimer coordinates (PDB 1OK8) shows that conformational fluctuations around 
      the hinge could open the pocket without dissociating the trimer or otherwise 
      generating molecular collisions. We propose that compounds such as 1662G07 trap the 
      sE trimer in a "pocket-open" state, which has lost affinity for the stem peptide and 
      cannot support the final "zipping up" of the stem.

AB  - Four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4), mosquito-borne members of Flaviviridae 
      family cause frequent epidemics causing considerable morbidity and mortality in 
      humans throughout tropical regions of the world. There is no vaccine or antiviral 
      therapeutics available for human use. In a previous study, we reported that 
      compounds containing the 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ) scaffold as inhibitors of West 
      Nile virus serine protease. In this study, we analyzed potencies of some compounds 
      with (8-HQ)-aminobenzothiazole derivatives for inhibition of DENV2 protease in 
      vitro. We identified analogs 1-4 with 2-aminothiazole or 2-aminobenzothiazole 
      scaffold with sub-micromolar potencies (IC(50)) in the in vitro protease assays. The 
      kinetic constant (K(i)) for the most potent 8-HQ-aminobenzothiazole inhibitor 
      (compound 1) with an IC(50) value of 0.91±0.05μM was determined to be 2.36±0.13μM. 
      This compound inhibits the DENV2 NS2B/NS3pro by a competitive mode of inhibition.

AB  - Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Dengue (DENV) viruses, both arboviruses, have caused 
      multiple outbreaks worldwide. Their clinical features are poorly described in Africa 
      and there is no comparative study, although Chikungunya is considered as a 
      dengue-like disease. We conducted a comparative study of clinical and biological 
      data from CHIKV and DENV positive patients during the 2010 Gabonese outbreak. 
      Patients consulting with general symptoms and having laboratory confirmation for 
      CHIKV or DENV were included. Clinical and biological data were recorded. Statistical 
      analyses were performed using Epi Info. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant. 
      In all, 270 CHIKV+, 53 DENV+ and 20 co-infected patients were included in the study. 
      Headaches, hemorrhage, leukopenia and lymphopenia were significantly (P respectively 
      0.01, 0.001, 0.02 and 0.001) more frequent in DENV+ patients than in CHIKV+. There 
      was no additive effect of the two viruses.These clinical and hematological disorders 
      are non specific and cannot assist for the differential diagnosis. These diseases 
      are clinically indistinguishable, and need for laboratory confirmation.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne human pathogen that causes a serious 
      public-health threat in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Neither a 
      vaccine to prevent nor an effective therapeutic agent to treat DENV infection is 
      currently available. We established a stable cell line harboring a 
      luciferase-reporting DENV subgenomic replicon to screen for inhibitors of DENV. A 
      total of 14,400 small-molecule (MW < 500 Da) chemicals were evaluated for their 
      ability to reduce luciferase reporter activity in cell lysates. One effective 
      compound was identified from the screening. This compound was found to reduce virus 
      production but did not block virus entry in virus-based assay. Mode-of-action 
      analysis revealed that this inhibitor suppressed viral RNA replication but did not 
      affect replicon translation. This compound potentially could be developed as an 
      anti-DENV agent and might be useful for dissecting the molecular mechanism of DENV 
      replication.

PG  - 409-16
LID - 10.2147/BTT.S37792 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue illness is one of the important mosquito-borne viral diseases in 
      tropical and subtropical regions. Four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, 
      DENV-3, and DENV-4) are classified in the Flavivirus genus of the family 
      Flaviviridae. We prepared monoclonal antibodies against DENV capsid protein from 
      mice immunized with DENV-2 and determined the cross-reactivity with each serotype of 
      DENV and Japanese encephalitis virus. METHODS AND RESULTS: To clarify the 
      relationship between the cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibodies and the diversity 
      of these viruses, we examined the situations of flaviviruses by analyses of 
      phylogenetic trees. Among a total of 60 prepared monoclonal antibodies specific for 
      DENV, five monoclonal antibodies stained the nuclei of infected cells and were found 
      to be specific to the capsid protein. Three were specific to DENV-2, while the other 
      two were cross-reactive with DENV-2 and DENV-4. No monoclonal antibodies were 
      cross-reactive with all four serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of DENV amino acid 
      sequences of the capsid protein revealed that DENV-2 and DENV-4 were clustered in 
      the same branch, while DENV-1 and DENV-3 were clustered in the other branch. 
      However, these classifications of the capsid protein were different from those of 
      the envelope and nonstructural 1 proteins. Phylogenetic distances between the four 
      serotypes of DENV were as different as those of other flaviviruses, such as Japanese 
      encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. Large variations in the DENV serotypes were 
      comparable with the differences between species of flavivirus. Furthermore, the 
      diversity of flavivirus capsid protein was much greater than that of envelope and 
      nonstructural 1 proteins. CONCLUSION: In this study, we produced specific monoclonal 
      antibodies that can be used to detect DENV-2 capsid protein, but not a 
      cross-reactive one with all serotypes of DENV capsid protein. The high diversity of 
      the DENV capsid protein sequence by phylogenetic analysis supported the low 
      cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibodies against DENV capsid protein.

AB  - Whereas the dengue virus (DENV) non-structural (NS) proteins NS3 and NS5 have been 
      shown to interact in vitro and in vivo, the biological relevance of this interaction 
      in viral replication has not been fully clarified. Here, we first applied a simple 
      and robust in vitro assay based on AlphaScreen technology in combination with the 
      wheat-germ cell-free protein production system to detect the DENV-2 NS3-NS5 
      interaction in a 384-well plate. The cell-free-synthesized NS3 and NS5 recombinant 
      proteins were soluble and in possession of their respective enzymatic activities in 
      vitro. In addition, AlphaScreen assays using the recombinant proteins detected a 
      specific interaction between NS3 and NS5 with a robust Z' factor of 0.71. By 
      employing the AlphaScreen assay, we found that both the N-terminal protease and 
      C-terminal helicase domains of NS3 are required for its association with NS5. 
      Furthermore, a competition assay revealed that the binding of full-length NS3 to NS5 
      was significantly inhibited by the addition of an excess of NS3 protease or helicase 
      domains. Our results demonstrate that the AlphaScreen assay can be used to discover 
      novel antiviral agents targeting the interactions between DENV NS proteins.

AB  - While advances in assay chemistry and detection continue to improve molecular 
      diagnostics technology, blood samples are still collected using the 150-year-old 
      needle/syringe method. Surface modified microprojection arrays have been developed 
      as a novel platform for in vivo, needle-free biomarker capture. These devices are 
      gold coated silicon arrays with >20,000 projections per cm(2), which can be applied 
      to the skin for tunable penetration into the epidermis or dermis. The 
      microprojection array conceptually offers several advantages over the current 
      methods including: minimally invasive sample collection, no need for sample 
      processing and concentration of specific markers at the device surface for sensitive 
      detection. In this study, Microprojection arrays were coated with antibodies to 
      capture an early marker of dengue virus infection, NS1, from the skin of live mice. 
      We also developed a complementary "total IgG" assay which could be used as a 
      positive control for adequate penetration of the projections. Surface modifications 
      designed for selective extraction were tested against standard microtiter plate 
      ELISA. We also investigated the use of Protein G-mediated antibody immobilization in 
      order to orient capture antibodies. While we found that capture efficiency could be 
      improved, the direct EDC-based antibody immobilization resulted in a significantly 
      higher surface density leading to a higher degree of NS1 capture. Using mice 
      intravenously injected with recombinant dengue virus type 2 NS1 as a pseudomodel for 
      dengue infection, NS1 was successfully extracted using microprojection arrays 
      sampling from skin fluid, with a detection limit of 8 μg/mL.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and residual effects of trypsin modulating 
      oostatic factor-Bacillus thuringiensis israeliensis (TMOF-Bti) formulations against 
      Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) (L.) larvae at UKM Campus Kuala Lumpur. METHODS: Twenty 
      first instar Ae. aegypti larvae were added in each bucket containing 4 L of water 
      supplied with crushed dried leaf powder as their source of food. Combination of 
      TMOF-Bti in rice husk formulation with the following weights viz 10, 25, 50 and 100 
      mg, respectively in duplicate was distributed in the buckets; while TMOF-Bti in 
      wettable powder formulation each weighing viz 2, 5, 10 and 20 mg, respectively in 
      duplicate was also placed in the buckets. The control buckets run in duplicate with 
      4 L of water and 20 first instar Ae. aegypti larvae. All buckets were covered with 
      mosquito netting. Larval mortality was recorded after 24 hours and weekly for five 
      weeks. A new batch of 20 1(st) instar larvae Ae. aegypti was introduced into each 
      bucket weekly without additional TMOF-Bti rice husk formulation or wettable powder. 
      The experiment was repeated for four times. RESULTS: The result of the study showed 
      that all formulations were very effective on the first two weeks by giving 100% 
      larval mortality for all concentrations applied. The TMOF (2%) + Bti (2%) had a good 
      residual effect until the end of 3(rd) week, TMOF (4%) + Bti (4%) until 4(th) week, 
      wettable powder TMOF (20%) + Bti (20%) until the third week. CONCLUSIONS: From the 
      results it can be concluded that the TMOF-Bti formulations can be utilized in dengue 
      vector control.

TI  - Chikungunya virus infection, a threat to public health.
PG  - 372-6
AB  - Many countries in the world have reported human infections by chikungunya virus 
      (CHIKV) a mosquito-borne togavirus belonging to the genus alpha virus. After half a 
      century of focal out breaks of acute febrile poly arthralgia, the disease had spread 
      unexpectedly in the past decade with large outbreaks in Africa around the Indian 
      Ocean and in Bangladesh. In Asia, CHIKV is thought to be transmitted by the same 
      mosquito as dengue, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Due to similarities in 
      clinical presentation with dengue, limited awareness and a lack of laboratory 
      diagnostic facilities, CHIKV is probably often under diagnosed or misdiagnosed as 
      dengue. Treatment is supportive. The prognosis is generally good although some 
      patients experience chronic arthritis. There is no vaccine or antiviral therapy 
      against CHIKV. Early identification of disease and control of vector will prevent 
      the spread of disease.

AB  - During the past ten years, the islands of Guadeloupe (French West Indies) are facing 
      dengue epidemics with increasing numbers of cases and fatal occurrences. The vector 
      Aedes aegypti is submitted to intensive control, with little effect on mosquito 
      populations. The hypothesis that important Ae. aegypti breeding sites are not 
      controlled is investigated herein. For that purpose, the roof gutters of 123 houses 
      were systematically investigated, and the percentage of gutters positive for Ae. 
      aegypti varied from 17.2% to 37.5%, from humid to dry locations. In the dryer 
      location, most of houses had no other breeding sites. The results show that roof 
      gutters are becoming the most important Ae. aegypti breeding sites in some locations 
      in Guadeloupe, with consequences on dengue transmission and vector control.

AB  - Mosquito midgut plays a crucial role in its vector susceptibility and pathogen 
      interaction. Identification of the sustainable microflora of the midgut environment 
      can therefore help in evaluating its contribution in mosquito-pathogen interaction 
      and in turn vector competence. To understand the bacterial diversity in the midgut 
      of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, we conducted a screening study of the gut microbes of 
      these mosquitoes which were either collected from fields or reared in the laboratory 
      "culture-dependent" approach. This work demonstrated that the microbial flora of 
      larvae and adult Ae. aegypti midgut is complex and is dominated by gram negative 
      proteobacteria. Serratia odorifera was found to be stably associated in the midguts 
      of field collected and laboratory reared larvae and adult females. The potential 
      influence of this sustainable gut microbe on DENV-2 susceptibility of this vector 
      was evaluated by co-feeding S. odorifera with DENV-2 to adult Ae. aegypti females 
      (free of gut flora). The observations revealed that the viral susceptibility of 
      these Aedes females enhanced significantly as compared to solely dengue-2 fed and 
      another gut inhabitant, Microbacterium oxydans co-fed females. Based on the results 
      of this study we proposed that the enhancement in the DENV-2 susceptibility of Ae. 
      aegypti females was due to blocking of prohibitin molecule present on the midgut 
      surface of these females by the polypeptide of gut inhabitant S. odorifera.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) remains the gold 
      standard for the detection of serologic immune responses to dengue virus (DENV). 
      While the basic concept of the PRNT remains constant, this test has evolved in 
      multiple laboratories, introducing variation in materials and methods. Despite the 
      importance of laboratory-to-laboratory comparability in DENV vaccine development, 
      the effects of differing PRNT techniques on assay results, particularly the use of 
      different dengue strains within a serotype, have not been fully characterized. 
      METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and pooled analysis of published 
      literature reporting individual-level PRNT titers to identify factors associated 
      with heterogeneity in PRNT results and compared variation between strains within 
      DENV serotypes and between articles using hierarchical models. RESULTS: The 
      literature search and selection criteria identified 8 vaccine trials and 25 natural 
      exposure studies reporting 4,411 titers from 605 individuals using 4 different 
      neutralization percentages, 3 cell lines, 12 virus concentrations and 51 strains. Of 
      1,057 titers from primary DENV exposure, titers to the exposure serotype were 
      consistently higher than titers to non-exposure serotypes. In contrast, titers from 
      secondary DENV exposures (n = 628) demonstrated high titers to exposure and 
      non-exposure serotypes. Additionally, PRNT titers from different strains within a 
      serotype varied substantially. A pooled analysis of 1,689 titers demonstrated strain 
      choice accounted for 8.04% (90% credible interval [CrI]: 3.05%, 15.7%) of 
      between-titer variation after adjusting for secondary exposure, time since DENV 
      exposure, vaccination and neutralization percentage. Differences between articles (a 
      proxy for inter-laboratory differences) accounted for 50.7% (90% CrI: 30.8%, 71.6%) 
      of between-titer variance. CONCLUSIONS: As promising vaccine candidates arise, the 
      lack of standardized assays among diagnostic and research laboratories make unbiased 
      inferences about vaccine-induced protection difficult. Clearly defined, widely 
      accessible reference reagents, proficiency testing or algorithms to adjust for 
      protocol differences would be a useful first step in improving dengue PRNT 
      comparability and quality assurance.

AB  - Domain III of the dengue virus envelope protein (EDIII, aa295-395) has an 
      immunoglobulin fold and is the proposed receptor-binding domain of the virus. 
      Previous studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies against EDIII can be 
      neutralizing and have therapeutic potential. Here, cloned Fab-phage libraries of 
      human and mouse origin were screened for DENV specific antibodies. Firstly, 
      bacterially expressed EDIII or whole virus particles were used as bait in biopanning 
      against a large naïve human Fab-phage library (>10 billion independent clones). 
      Multiple panning strategies were employed, and in excess of 1000 clones were 
      screened, but all of the antibodies identified bound the envelope in regions outside 
      EDIII suggesting EDIII antibodies are virtually absent from the naïve human 
      repertoire. Next, a chimeric Fab-phage library was constructed from a panel of EDIII 
      specific mouse hybridomas by pooling the VH and VL chain sequences from the 
      hybridomas and cloning these into the pComb3X phagemid vector with human CH and CL 
      encoding sequences. Biopanning against EDIII identified a unique antibody (C9) that 
      cross-reacts with EDIII from DENV1-3 and, in the IgG format, binds and neutralizes 
      DENV2 in cell-based assays. Sequence analysis and saturation mutagenesis of 
      complementary determining regions (CDR) in the C9 light chain suggest an antigen 
      recognition model in which the LCDR3 is a key determinant of EDIII specificity, 
      while modifications in LCDR1 and LCDR2 affect DENV serotype cross-reactivity. 
      Overall, this study supports the current prevailing opinion that neutralizing 
      anti-EDIII monoclonal antibodies can be readily generated in murine systems, but in 
      humans the anti-DENV immune response is directed away from domain III.

TI  - Novel approaches to flavivirus drug discovery.
PG  - 417-28
LID - 10.1517/17460441.2012.673579 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The members of the family Flaviviridae, including West Nile virus, 
      yellow fever virus and dengue virus, are important human pathogens that are 
      expanding their impact around the globe. The four serotypes of dengue infect 50-100 
      million people each year, yet the only clinical treatment is supportive care to 
      reduce symptoms. Drugs that employ novel inhibition mechanisms and targets are 
      urgently needed to combat the growing incidence of dengue worldwide. AREAS COVERED: 
      The authors discuss recently discovered flavivirus inhibitors with a focus on 
      antivirals targeting non-enzymatic proteins of the dengue virus lifecycle. 
      Specifically, the authors discuss the flaviviruses, the need for novel inhibitors 
      and the criteria for successful antiviral drug development. Current literature 
      describing new advances in antiviral therapy at each stage of the flavivirus 
      lifecycle (entry, endosomal escape, viral RNA processing and replication, assembly 
      and immune evasion) are evaluated and summarized. EXPERT OPINION: Overall, the 
      prognosis of flavivirus antiviral drug development is positive: new effective 
      compounds have been discovered and studied. However, repurposing existing compounds 
      and a greater translation to the clinical setting are recommended in order to combat 
      the growing threat of flaviviruses.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antiprotozoal and antiviral activities 
      of four Argentinean Mikania species. The organic and aqueous extracts of Mikania 
      micrantha, M. parodii, M. periplocifolia, and M. cordifolia were tested on 
      Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes, Leishmania braziliensis promastigotes, and dengue 
      virus type 2. The organic extract of M. micrantha was the most active against T. 
      cruzi and L. braziliensis exhibiting a growth inhibition of 77.6 ± 4.5% and 84.9 ± 
      6.1%, respectively, at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The bioguided fractionation of 
      M. micrantha organic extract led to the identification of two active fractions. The 
      chromatographic profile and infrared analysis of these fractions revealed the 
      presence of sesquiterpene lactones. None of the tested extracts were active against 
      dengue virus type 2.

LID - e1002934
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a pathogen with a high impact on human health. It replicates 
      in a wide range of cells involved in the immune response. To efficiently infect 
      humans, DENV must evade or inhibit fundamental elements of the innate immune system, 
      namely the type I interferon response. DENV circumvents the host immune response by 
      expressing proteins that antagonize the cellular innate immunity. We have recently 
      documented the inhibition of type I IFN production by the proteolytic activity of 
      DENV NS2B3 protease complex in human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). In 
      the present report we identify the human adaptor molecule STING as a target of the 
      NS2B3 protease complex. We characterize the mechanism of inhibition of type I IFN 
      production in primary human MDDCs by this viral factor. Using different human and 
      mouse primary cells lacking STING, we show enhanced DENV replication. Conversely, 
      mutated versions of STING that cannot be cleaved by the DENV NS2B3 protease induced 
      higher levels of type I IFN after infection with DENV. Additionally, we show that 
      DENV NS2B3 is not able to degrade the mouse version of STING, a phenomenon that 
      severely restricts the replication of DENV in mouse cells, suggesting that STING 
      plays a key role in the inhibition of DENV infection and spread in mice.

AB  - The entry of DENV into the host cell appears to be a very complex process which has 
      been started to be studied in detail. In this report, the route of functional 
      intracellular trafficking after endocytic uptake of dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) 
      strain HW, DENV-2 strain NGC and DENV-2 strain 16681 into Vero cells was studied by 
      using a susceptibility to ammonium chloride assay, dominant negative mutants of 
      several members of the family of cellular Rab GTPases that participate in regulation 
      of transport through endosome vesicles and immunofluorescence colocalization. 
      Together, the results presented demonstrate that in spite of the different 
      internalization route among viral serotypes in Vero cells and regardless of the 
      viral strain, DENV particles are first transported to early endosomes in a 
      Rab5-dependent manner. Then a Rab7-dependent pathway guides DENV-2 16681 to late 
      endosomes, whereas a yet unknown sorting event controls the transport of DENV-2 NGC, 
      and most probably DENV-1 HW, to the perinuclear recycling compartments where fusion 
      membrane would take place releasing nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. Besides the 
      demonstration of a different intracellular trafficking for two DENV-2 strains that 
      shared the initial clathrin-independent internalization route, these studies proved 
      for the first time the involvement of the slow recycling pathway for DENV-2 
      productive infection.

TI  - [Mast cells in viral infections].
PG  - 231-41
AB  -   There are some premises suggesting that mast cells are involved in the mechanisms 
      of anti-virus defense and in viral disease pathomechanisms. Mast cells are 
      particularly numerous at the portals of infections and thus may have immediate and 
      easy contact with the external environment and invading pathogens. These cells 
      express receptors responsible for recognition of virus-derived PAMP molecules, 
      mainly Toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7/8 and TLR9), but also RIG-I-like and NOD-like 
      molecules. Furthermore, mast cells generate various mediators, cytokines and 
      chemokines which modulate the intensity of inflammation and regulate the course of 
      innate and adaptive anti-viral immunity. Indirect evidence for the role of mast 
      cells in viral infections is also provided by clinical observations and results of 
      animal studies. Currently, more and more data indicate that mast cells can be 
      infected by some viruses (dengue virus, adenoviruses, hantaviruses, 
      cytomegaloviruses, reoviruses, HIV-1 virus). It is also demonstrated that mast cells 
      can release pre formed mediators as well as synthesize de novo eicosanoids in 
      response to stimulation by viruses. Several data indicate that virus-stimulated mast 
      cells secrete cytokines and chemokines, including interferons as well as chemokines 
      with a key role in NK and Tc lymphocyte influx. Moreover, some information indicates 
      that mast cell stimulation via TLR3, TLR7/8 and TLR9 can affect their adhesion to 
      extracellular matrix proteins and chemotaxis, and influence expression of some 
      membrane molecules. Critical analysis of current data leads to the conclusion that 
      it is not yet possible to make definitive statements about the role of mast cells in 
      innate and acquired defense mechanisms developing in the course of viral infection 
      and/or pathomechanisms of viral diseases.

      disaccharide derivatives against dengue virus.

AB  - Enzymes involved in N-glycan processing are targets of interest in the inhibition of 
      host processes for the blockade of dengue virus (DENV) morphogenesis. Of the ten 
      proteins encoded by DENV, three have N-glycosylation sites, namely 
      pre-membrane/membrane protein (prM/M), envelope protein (E) and non-structural 
      protein-1 (NS1). It is known that aberrations in the oligosaccharide portions at 
      these N-glycan sites affect proper folding of these proteins during the translation 
      process that, in turn, affects the morphogenesis of the budding DENV. Here we report 
      on the testing for antiviral activity of four known sulfonium-ion α-glucosidase 
      inhibitors and two 5-thiomannosylamine disaccharide derivatives against DENV. Two of 
      the sulfonium ions tested, namely, kotalanol and its de-O-sulfonated derivative, 
      naturally occurring potent intestinal α-glucosidase inhibitors, had comparable 
      inhibitory activity [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50))=25.1±13.1 μM and 50.4±8.6 
      μM, respectively] with that of ribavirin (IC(50)=25.2±8.3 μM), a commercially 
      available antiviral agent. The 5-thiomannosylamines did not show any activity at the 
      concentrations tested.

TI  - Dengue virus infection induces upregulation of hn RNP-H and PDIA3 for its 
      multiplication in the host cell.
PG  - 573-9
LID - 10.1016/j.virusres.2011.12.010 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenic mechanism of Dengue virus (DENV) infection is related to the host 
      responses within target cells and therefore, we assessed intracellular changes in 
      host cell proteins following DENV infection. This study provides evidence that 
      heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (hnRNP-H) and protein disulfide isomerase 
      A3 (PDIA3) helps in DENV multiplication by suppressing TNF-α production in human 
      monocytic THP1 cells. Proteomic analysis of infected cells, identified upregulation 
      of the host cell proteins PDIA3 and hnRNP-H in comparison to mock infected cells. 
      The functional role of hnRNP-H and PDIA3 in DENV infection was identified by down 
      regulating hnRNP-H and PDIA3 genes with their specific siRNA duplexes which lead to 
      decreased intracellular viral load. It also resulted in increased TNF-α level which 
      mediates antiviral effect. This is the first study, which reports the role of PDIA3 
      and hnRNP-H in TNF-α production in DENV infected cells. Collectively, these results 
      suggest that increased level of hnRNP-H and PDIA3 expression in DENV infected THP1 
      cells assist in the viral replication by suppressing the TNF-α production.

      aegypti in São Paulo, Brazil.
PG  - 2794-802
LID - 10.1002/ece3.392 [doi]
AB  - Population genetic studies of insect vectors can generate knowledge to improve 
      epidemiological studies focused on the decrease of pathogen transmission. In this 
      study, we used nine SNPs across the Aedes aegypti genome to characterize seasonal 
      population variations of this important dengue vector. Mosquito samples were 
      obtained by ovitraps placed over Botucatu SP from 2005 to 2010. Our data show that, 
      regardless of the large variation in mosquito abundance (deduced from the number of 
      eggs obtained from ovitraps), the effective population size remained stable over the 
      years. These results suggest that Ae. aegypti is able to maintain a sufficiently 
      large active breeding population during the dry season to keep genetic frequencies 
      stable. These results open new perspectives on mosquito survey and control methods.

TI  - Flaviviral helicase: insights into the mechanism of action of a motor protein.
PG  - 84-7
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.11.060 [doi]
AB  - Motor proteins are involved in crucial cell activities, such as cargo transport or 
      nucleic acid remodeling, by converting the free energy of ATP hydrolysis into motion 
      or mechanical work. Flavivirus helicase is a motor protein involved in dsRNA 
      separation during viral replication, thus essential for virus infection. Since a 
      clear vision of the protein activity, in particular of the relationship between ATP 
      cycling and dynamics, is missing, we carried over a molecular dynamics study on 
      Dengue virus helicase in its ATP bound and unbound states. Our simulations show 
      different opening levels of the ssRNA access site to the helicase core. 
      Specifically, we show that ATP induces a closed state into the ssRNA access site, 
      likely involved in the helicase unwinding activity.

TI  - Immune transcript variations among Aedes aegypti populations with distinct 
      susceptibility to dengue virus serotype 2.
PG  - 113-9
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.07.006 [doi]
AB  - The innate immune response of insects is one of the factors that may dictate their 
      susceptibility to viral infection. Two immune signaling pathways, Toll and JAK-STAT, 
      and the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway are involved in Aedes aegypti responses 
      against dengue virus (DENV), however natural differences in these antiviral defenses 
      among mosquito populations have not been studied. Here, two field Ae. aegypti 
      populations from distinct ecological environments, one from Recife and the other 
      from Petrolina (Brazil), and a laboratory strain were studied for their ability to 
      replicate a primary isolate of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). Virus infectivity 
      and replication were determined in insect tissues collected after viral exposure 
      through reverse-transcription real time PCR (RT-PCR). The expression of a transcript 
      representing these defense mechanisms (Toll, JAK-STAT and RNAi) in the midgut and 
      fat body was studied with RT-PCR to evaluate variations in innate immune mechanisms 
      possibly employed against DENV. Analyses of infection rates indicated that the field 
      populations were more susceptible to DENV-2 infection than the lab strain. There 
      were distinct expression patterns among mosquito populations, in both control and 
      infected insects. Moreover, lower expression of immune molecules in DENV-2-infected 
      insects compared to controls was observed in the two field populations. These 
      results suggest that natural variations in vector competence against DENV may be 
      partly due to differences in mosquito defense mechanisms, and that the 
      down-regulation of immune transcripts after viral infection depends on the insect 
      strain.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a major mosquito-borne pathogen infecting up to 100 million 
      people each year; so far no effective treatment or vaccines are available. Recently, 
      highly cross-reactive and infection-enhancing pre-membrane (prM)-specific antibodies 
      were found to dominate the anti-DENV immune response in humans, raising concern over 
      vaccine candidates that contain native dengue prM sequences. In this study, we have 
      isolated a broadly cross-reactive prM-specific antibody, D29, during a screen with a 
      non-immunized human Fab-phage library against the four serotypes of DENV. The 
      antibody is capable of restoring the infectivity of virtually non-infectious 
      immature DENV (imDENV) in FcγR-bearing K562 cells. Remarkably, D29 also 
      cross-reacted with a cryptic epitope on the envelope (E) protein located to the 
      DI/DII junction as evidenced by site-directed mutagenesis. This cryptic epitope, 
      while inaccessible to antibody binding in a native virus particle, may become 
      exposed if E is not properly folded. These findings suggest that generation of 
      anti-prM antibodies that enhance DENV infection may not be completely avoided even 
      with immunization strategies employing E protein alone or subunits of E proteins.

AB  - Change in pH plays a crucial role in the stability and function of the dengue 
      envelope (DENV) protein during conformational transition from dimeric (pre-fusion 
      state) to trimeric form (post-fusion state). In the present study we have performed 
      various molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the trimeric DENV protein at 
      different pH and ionic concentrations. We have used total binding energy to justify 
      the stability of the complex using the MMPBSA method. We found a remarkable increase 
      in the stability of the complex at neutral pH (pH~7) due to the increment of sodium 
      ions. However, at very low pH (pH~4), the total energy of the complex becomes high 
      enough to destabilize the complex. At a specific pH, almost at a range of 6, the 
      stability of the complex is significantly better than the stability of the trimer at 
      neutral pH, which connotes that the trimer is most stable at this pH (pH~6).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Physiological resistance of natural population of Aedes aegypti to 
      insecticides contribute to the decreased efficacy of chemical control as a main 
      control strategy during dengue outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: The susceptibility status of 
      Ae. aegypti was assessed for the carbamate propoxur, the adulticide malathion and 
      the larvicide temephos on 13 natural populations of Ae. aegypti immature forms were 
      taken from 8 Colombian localities. These included the following: Bucaramanga (1), 
      Sabana de Torres (2), Girardot (2), La Mesa (2), Villavicencio (2), Puerto López 
      (2), San José del Guaviare (1) and Florencia (1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Susceptibility tests mainly consisted of the standardized bioassay outlined by WHO 
      (1981) and CDC bottles (1998). Colorimetric tests were undertaken to determine 
      enzyme levels possibly responsible for the reduction of susceptibility to 
      organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. RESULTS: All specimens demonstrated 
      susceptibility to malathion and propoxur insecticides. Four of the 13 populations 
      revealed susceptibility to the temephos larvicide. Seven of 11 populations showed a 
      limited increase in values for nonspecific esterase enzymes. The Bucaramanga 
      population was the only one which showed an increase in the cytochrome P450 
      monooxygenases enzymes. Neither population was found with modified 
      acetilcolinesterase. CONCLUSIONS: The widespread susceptibility to organophosphates 
      used as adulticides indicated that malathion, the most used insecticide in Colombia, 
      remains effective in interrupting the transmission of dengue. Physiological 
      resistance to insecticides occurring in communities of a single township proved to 
      be a localized phenomenon.

AB  - Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) mediates antiviral response by recognizing 
      double-stranded RNA. Its cytoplasmic domain is tyrosine phosphorylated upon ligand 
      binding and initiates downstream signaling via the adapter TIR-containing adaptor 
      inducing interferon-β (TRIF). However, the kinase responsible for TLR3 
      phosphorylation remains unknown. We show here that Bruton's tyrosine kinase 
      (BTK)-deficient macrophages failed to secrete inflammatory cytokines and IFN-β upon 
      TLR3 stimulation and were impaired in clearing intracellular dengue virus infection. 
      Mutant mice were also less susceptible to d-galactosamine/p(I:C)-induced sepsis. In 
      the absence of BTK, TLR3-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT and MAPK 
      signaling and activation of NFκB, IRF3, and AP-1 transcription factors were all 
      defective. We demonstrate that BTK directly phosphorylates TLR3 and in particular 
      the critical Tyr759 residue. BTK point mutations that abrogate or led to 
      constitutive kinase activity have opposite effects on TLR3 phosphorylation. Loss of 
      BTK also compromises the formation of the downstream TRIF/receptor-interacting 
      protein 1 (RIP1)/TBK1 complex. Thus, BTK plays a critical role in initiating TLR3 
      signaling.

AB  - Dengue viruses (DVs) are responsible for the most medically relevant arboviral 
      diseases. However, the molecular interactions mediating DV entry are poorly 
      understood. We determined that TIM and TAM proteins, two receptor families that 
      mediate the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer)-dependent phagocytic removal of apoptotic 
      cells, serve as DV entry factors. Cells poorly susceptible to DV are robustly 
      infected after ectopic expression of TIM or TAM receptors. Conversely, DV infection 
      of susceptible cells is inhibited by anti-TIM or anti-TAM antibodies or knockdown of 
      TIM and TAM expression. TIM receptors facilitate DV entry by directly interacting 
      with virion-associated PtdSer. TAM-mediated infection relies on indirect DV 
      recognition, in which the TAM ligand Gas6 acts as a bridging molecule by binding to 
      PtdSer within the virion. This dual mode of virus recognition by TIM and TAM 
      receptors reveals how DVs usurp the apoptotic cell clearance pathway for infectious 
      entry.

      mechanism at the promoter level.

AB  - Unlike many other viruses that downregulate MHC class I expression on infected cell 
      membranes, flaviviruses were reported to upregulate the MHC class I expression. 
      Dengue virus was shown to induce HLA class I expression; however, the precise 
      transcriptional mechanism that is used by the virus remains unclear. This article 
      assessed the findings of a recently published report describing the mechanism used 
      by dengue virus to induce HLA-A2 expression and characterizing the transcription 
      factors that are involved. The study showed that p50/p65 and p65/65 NF-κB dimers 
      bind to the class I regulatory complex within the HLA-A2 promoter. This finding and 
      its significance for the design of possible antiviral therapeutic agents are 
      discussed in this article.

AB  - In October 2009, two-3 months after an outbreak of a febrile disease with joint pain 
      on the eastern coast of Madagascar, we assessed serologic markers for chikungunya 
      virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in 1,244 
      pregnant women at 6 locations. In 2 eastern coast towns, IgG seroprevalence against 
      CHIKV was 45% and 23%; IgM seroprevalence was 28% and 5%. IgG seroprevalence against 
      DENV was 17% and 11%. No anti-DENV IgM was detected. At 4 locations, 450-1,300 m 
      high, IgG seroprevalence against CHIKV was 0%-3%, suggesting CHIKV had not spread to 
      higher inland-altitudes. Four women had IgG against RVFV, probably antibodies from a 
      2008 epidemic. Most (78%) women from coastal locations with CHIKV-specific IgG 
      reported joint pain and stiffness; 21% reported no symptoms. CHIKV infection was 
      significantly associated with high bodyweight. The outbreak was an isolated CHIKV 
      epidemic without relevant DENV co-transmission.

TI  - Analysis of epitopes on dengue virus envelope protein recognized by monoclonal 
      antibodies and polyclonal human sera by a high throughput assay.
PG  - e1447
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001447 [doi]
LID - e1447
AB  - BACKGROUND: The envelope (E) protein of dengue virus (DENV) is the major target of 
      neutralizing antibodies and vaccine development. While previous studies on domain 
      III or domain I/II alone have reported several epitopes of monoclonal antibodies 
      (mAbs) against DENV E protein, the possibility of interdomain epitopes and the 
      relationship between epitopes and neutralizing potency remain largely unexplored. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a dot blot assay by using 67 alanine 
      mutants of predicted surface-exposed E residues as a systematic approach to identify 
      epitopes recognized by mAbs and polyclonal sera, and confirmed our findings using a 
      capture-ELISA assay. Of the 12 mouse mAbs tested, three recognized a novel epitope 
      involving residues (Q211, D215, P217) at the central interface of domain II, and 
      three recognized residues at both domain III and the lateral ridge of domain II, 
      suggesting a more frequent presence of interdomain epitopes than previously 
      appreciated. Compared with mAbs generated by traditional protocols, the potent 
      neutralizing mAbs generated by a new protocol recognized multiple residues in A 
      strand or residues in C strand/CC' loop of DENV2 and DENV1, and multiple residues in 
      BC loop and residues in DE loop, EF loop/F strand or G strand of DENV1. The 
      predominant epitopes of anti-E antibodies in polyclonal sera were found to include 
      both fusion loop and non-fusion residues in the same or adjacent monomer. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our analyses have implications for epitope-specific 
      diagnostics and epitope-based dengue vaccines. This high throughput method has 
      tremendous application for mapping both intra and interdomain epitopes recognized by 
      human mAbs and polyclonal sera, which would further our understanding of humoral 
      immune responses to DENV at the epitope level.

AB  - Flavivirus infections (including Japanese encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis and 
      dengue fever/severe dengue) present a worldwide public health problem. Recent 
      climate change may affect the geographical distribution of the arthropod vectors for 
      these viruses and so the risk of flavivirus epidemics may increase. Many methods 
      have been developed for the serological diagnosis of flavivirus infections, such as 
      haemagglutination inhibition assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and 
      immunofluorescence in staining. However, the specificity of these assays varies. The 
      plaque reduction neutralizing test (PRNT) using live viruses is currently the 'gold 
      standard' for the differential serodiagnosis of flaviviruses. The specificity of 
      results obtained with PRNT is better than that for other protocols and many 
      laboratories apply the PRNT protocol to the differential serodiagnosis of 
      flaviviruses. Here, recent refinements to the PRNT protocols with genetically 
      modified recombinant viruses or reporter-harbouring virus-like particles are 
      reviewed. Further, the problems associated with the differential serodiagnosis of 
      flaviviruses using PRNT are discussed.

AB  - RNA modification plays an important role in modulating host-pathogen interaction. 
      Flavivirus NS5 protein encodes N-7 and 2'-O methyltransferase activities that are 
      required for the formation of 5' type I cap (m(7)GpppAm) of viral RNA genome. Here 
      we reported, for the first time, that flavivirus NS5 has a novel internal RNA 
      methylation activity. Recombinant NS5 proteins of West Nile virus and Dengue virus 
      (serotype 4; DENV-4) specifically methylates polyA, but not polyG, polyC, or polyU, 
      indicating that the methylation occurs at adenosine residue. RNAs with internal 
      adenosines substituted with 2'-O-methyladenosines are not active substrates for 
      internal methylation, whereas RNAs with adenosines substituted with 
      N⁶-methyladenosines can be efficiently methylated, suggesting that the internal 
      methylation occurs at the 2'-OH position of adenosine. Mass spectroscopic analysis 
      further demonstrated that the internal methylation product is 2'-O-methyladenosine. 
      Importantly, genomic RNA purified from DENV virion contains 2'-O-methyladenosine. 
      The 2'-O methylation of internal adenosine does not require specific RNA sequence 
      since recombinant methyltransferase of DENV-4 can efficiently methylate RNAs 
      spanning different regions of viral genome, host ribosomal RNAs, and polyA. 
      Structure-based mutagenesis results indicate that K61-D146-K181-E217 tetrad of 
      DENV-4 methyltransferase forms the active site of internal methylation activity; in 
      addition, distinct residues within the methyl donor (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) 
      pocket, GTP pocket, and RNA-binding site are critical for the internal methylation 
      activity. Functional analysis using flavivirus replicon and genome-length RNAs 
      showed that internal methylation attenuated viral RNA translation and replication. 
      Polymerase assay revealed that internal 2'-O-methyladenosine reduces the efficiency 
      of RNA elongation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that flavivirus NS5 
      performs 2'-O methylation of internal adenosine of viral RNA in vivo and host 
      ribosomal RNAs in vitro.

AB  - RNA virus exploration within the field of medical virology has greatly benefited 
      from technological developments in genomics, deepening our understanding of viral 
      dynamics and emergence. Large-scale first-generation technology sequencing projects 
      have expedited molecular epidemiology studies at an unprecedented scale for two 
      pathogenic RNA viruses chosen as models: influenza A virus and dengue. 
      Next-generation sequencing approaches are now leading to a more in-depth analysis of 
      virus genetic diversity, which is greater for RNA than DNA viruses because of high 
      replication rates and the absence of proofreading activity of the RNA-dependent RNA 
      polymerase. In the field of virus discovery, technological advancements and 
      metagenomic approaches are expanding the catalogs of novel viruses by facilitating 
      our probing into the RNA virus world.

AB  - The flavivirus nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) bears multiple enzymatic activities and 
      represents an attractive target for antiviral intervention. NS3 contains the viral 
      serine protease at the N-terminus and ATPase, RTPase, and helicase activities at the 
      C-terminus. These activities are essential for viral replication; however, the 
      biological role of RNA remodeling by NS3 helicase during the viral life cycle is 
      still unclear. Secondary and tertiary RNA structures present in the viral genome are 
      crucial for viral replication. Here, we used the NS3 protein from dengue virus to 
      investigate functions of NS3 associated to changes in RNA structures. Using 
      different NS3 variants, we characterized a domain spanning residues 171 to 618 that 
      displays ATPase and RNA unwinding activities similar to those observed for the 
      full-length protein. Interestingly, we found that, besides the RNA unwinding 
      activity, dengue virus NS3 greatly accelerates annealing of complementary RNA 
      strands with viral or non-viral sequences. This new activity was found to be 
      ATP-independent. It was determined that a mutated NS3 lacking ATPase activity 
      retained full-RNA annealing activity. Using an ATP regeneration system and different 
      ATP concentrations, we observed that NS3 establishes an ATP-dependent steady state 
      between RNA unwinding and annealing, allowing modulation of the two opposing 
      activities of this enzyme through ATP concentration. In addition, we observed that 
      NS3 enhanced RNA-RNA interactions between molecules representing the ends of the 
      viral genome that are known to be necessary for viral RNA synthesis. We propose 
      that, according to the ATP availability, NS3 could function regulating the folding 
      or unfolding of viral RNA structures.

AB  - The immobilization of the glucose/mannose-binding lectin from Concanavalia 
      ensiformis seeds (ConA) onto a monolayer made of a galactomannan extracted from 
      Leucaena leucocephala seeds (GML), which was adsorbed onto - amino-terminated 
      surfaces, was investigated by means of ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy. The 
      mean thickness of GML monolayer, which polysaccharide consists of linear 1→4-linked 
      β-D-mannopyranosil units partially substituted at C-6 by α-D-galactopyranosyl units, 
      amounted to (1.5±0.2) nm. ConA molecules adsorbed onto GML surfaces forming 
      (2.0±0.5) nm thick layers. However, in the presence of mannose the adsorption 
      failed, indicating that ConA binding sites were blocked by mannose and were no 
      longer available for mannose units present in the GML backbone. The GML film was 
      also used as support for the adsorption of three serotypes of dengue virus particles 
      (DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3), where DENV-2 formed the thickest film (4±2) nm. The 
      adsorbed layer of DENV-2 onto ConA-covered GML surfaces presented mean thickness 
      values similar to that determined for DENV-2 onto bare GML surfaces. The addition of 
      free mannose units prevented DENV-2 adsorption onto ConA-covered GML films by ~50%, 
      suggesting competition between virus and mannose for ConA binding sites. This 
      finding suggests that if ConA is also adsorbed to GML surface and its binding site 
      is blocked by free mannose, virus particles are able to recognized GML mannose 
      unities substituted by galactose. Interactions between polysaccharides thin films, 
      proteins, and viruses are of great relevance since they can provide basis for the 
      development of biotechnological devices. These results indicate that GML is a 
      potential polysaccharide for biomaterials development, as those could involve 
      interactions between ConA in immune system and viruses.

TI  - Dengue virus presence and surveillance in Okinawa (Review).
PG  - 15-17
AB  - Recent reports have shown that the dengue virus (DENV) is a serious concern 
      worldwide, especially in subtropical areas such as South-East Asia. With the 
      development of transportation systems, the risk of DENV infection spreading is 
      increasing. Since mosquitoes transmit DENV to humans, surveillance of DENV-infected 
      mosquito vectors is the most effective approach for preventing DENV. Okinawa is the 
      only prefecture located in a subtropical region in Japan and historically shows 
      continuous importation of DENV-related mosquito vectors. In this review, we describe 
      the current and historical status of DENV in Okinawa.

TI  - Establishment of a stable cell line coexpressing dengue virus-2 and green 
      fluorescent protein for screening of antiviral compounds.
PG  - 283-92
LID - 10.1177/1087057111426903 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to generate a stable cell line harboring subgenomic dengue virus 
      replicon and a green fluorescent gene (DENV/GFP) for a cell-based model to screen 
      anti-DENV compounds. The gene-encoding envelope protein of DENV-2 was deleted and 
      then replaced with fragments of the GFP gene and a foot-and-mouth-disease virus 
      2A-derived cleavage site. The human cytomegalovirus immediate early and antisense 
      hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequences were added at the 5'- and 3'-ends. An 
      internal ribosome entry site and neomycin resistance genes were placed upstream and 
      next to the NS1 gene. The recombinant plasmids were propagated in a mammalian cell 
      line. A stable cell line with the brightest green fluorescent protein and the 
      highest viral protein and RNA expression was selected from six clones. The clone was 
      then examined for effectiveness in an antiviral drug screening assay with compounds 
      isolated from the local plants using two known antiviral agents as controls. Two 
      novel flavones, PMF and TMF, were discovered having DENV-inhibitory properties. The 
      data were validated by a conventional plaque titration assay. The results indicate 
      that this newly developed cell line is efficient for use as a cell-based model for 
      primary screening of anti-DENV compounds.

AB  - The antiviral activities of extracts from Daucus maritimus seeds were investigated 
      against the reverse transcriptase of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and a 
      panel of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of dengue virus, West Nile virus (WNV) and 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV). The extracts showed moderate to potent inhibition rates 
      against the four viral polymerases. The ethyl acetate extract exhibited a potent 
      inhibitory effect against WNV's RdRp, with an IC₅₀ value of 8 µg mL⁻¹. The F₂ 
      fraction exhibited potent inhibitory activity against WNV and HCV's RdRps, with IC₅₀ 
      values 1 and 5 µg mL⁻¹, respectively. The P₂ fraction also showed potent inhibitory 
      effects on WNV and HCV's RdRps, with IC₅₀ values 2.7 and 4 µg mL⁻¹, respectively. 
      The results suggest that these extracts are candidates for the development of new 
      anti-WNV RpDp and anti-HCV RpDp agents.

AB  - Aspergillus niger is a fungus of the genus Aspergillus. It has caused a disease 
      called black mold on certain fruits and vegetables. The culture filtrates released 
      from the A. niger ATCC 66566 were grown in Czapek dox broth (CDB) then filtered with 
      flash chromatograph and were used for the bioassay after a growth of thirty days. 
      The result demonstrated these mortalities with LC(50), LC(90), and LC(99) values of 
      Culex quinquefasciatus 0.76, 3.06, and 4.75, Anopheles stephensi 1.43, 3.2, and 
      3.86, and Aedes aegypti 1.43, 2.2, and 4.1 μl/cm(2), after exposure of seven hours. 
      We have calculated significant LT(90) values of Cx. quinquefasciatus 4.5, An. 
      stephensi 3.54, and Ae. aegypti 6.0 hrs, respectively. This liquid spray of fungal 
      culture isolate of A. niger can reduce malaria, dengue, and filarial transmission. 
      These results significantly support broadening the current vector control paradigm 
      beyond chemical adulticides.

TI  - A noncoding RNA produced by arthropod-borne flaviviruses inhibits the cellular 
      exoribonuclease XRN1 and alters host mRNA stability.
PG  - 2029-40
LID - 10.1261/rna.034330.112 [doi]
AB  - All arthropod-borne flaviviruses generate a short noncoding RNA (sfRNA) from the 
      viral 3' untranslated region during infection due to stalling of the cellular 
      5'-to-3' exonuclease XRN1. We show here that formation of sfRNA also inhibits XRN1 
      activity. Cells infected with Dengue or Kunjin viruses accumulate uncapped mRNAs, 
      decay intermediates normally targeted by XRN1. XRN1 repression also resulted in the 
      increased overall stability of cellular mRNAs in flavivirus-infected cells. 
      Importantly, a mutant Kunjin virus that cannot form sfRNA but replicates to normal 
      levels failed to affect host mRNA stability or XRN1 activity. Expression of sfRNA in 
      the absence of viral infection demonstrated that sfRNA formation was directly 
      responsible for the stabilization of cellular mRNAs. Finally, numerous cellular 
      mRNAs were differentially expressed in an sfRNA-dependent fashion in a Kunjin virus 
      infection. We conclude that flaviviruses incapacitate XRN1 during infection and 
      dysregulate host mRNA stability as a result of sfRNA formation.

AB  - In Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the status of insecticide resistance has not recently been 
      evaluated for Aedes aegypti (L) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) populations. No 
      prophylactics exist for dengue, so prevention is only through vector control 
      methods. An earthquake occurred in Haiti on January 12, 2010, with a magnitude of 
      7.0 Mw that devastated the area. Dengue became a major concern for the humanitarian 
      relief workers that entered the country. Bottle bioassays were conducted in the 
      field on adult mosquitoes reared from larvae collected from the grounds of the U.S. 
      Embassy and from an adjacent neighborhood in eastern Port-au-Prince, Haiti. At the 
      CDC, Fort Collins, CO, bioassays, molecular, and biochemical assays were performed 
      on mosquitoes reared from field-collected eggs. A small percentage of the population 
      was able to survive the diagnostic dose in bioassays run in Haiti. Mosquitoes tested 
      at the CDC demonstrated no phenotypic resistance. A variety of factors could be 
      responsible for the discrepancies between the field and lab data, but temperature 
      and larval nutrition are probably most important. Knowledge of localized resistance 
      and underlying mechanisms helps in making rational decisions in selection of 
      appropriate and effective insecticides in the event of a dengue outbreak.

TI  - [Impact of an educational intervention carried out in anti-vector campaign workers].
PG  - 304-14
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Aedes aegypti is a common vector in Cuba, which damages human health. 
      Santiago de Cuba is one of the provinces with high number of mosquito foci in a 
      sustained way. Therefore, it is very important, from the social viewpoint, to carry 
      out educational interventions with anti-vector campaign workers in Mella 
      municipality in this province. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the impact of an educational 
      intervention on dengue, Aedes aegypti and monitoring actions with anti-vector 
      program workers from Mella municipality in Santiago de Cuba. METHODS: a 
      quasi-experimental research was conducted before and after the educational 
      intervention from November to December, 2010. Lectures and workshops were given in 
      each of the three health areas of the municipality. The sample was made up of 64 
      workers. The addressed topics were dengue, Aedes aegypti and actions to control 
      them. An Excel database was created. Wilconxon's sign tests were applied to check 
      changes in knowledge. SPSS statistical processor was used (11.5 version). RESULTS: 
      before the educational interveption, the knowledge on dengue was broader than those 
      on the rest of the addressed topics. After the intervention, except for the 
      responses about the disease, the rest of the topics increased their initial 
      assessment values. The topic Aedes aegypti had the highest number of satisfactory 
      answers (100 %), followed by actions to control the vector (90 %). CONCLUSIONS: the 
      educational strategy was effective, since it achieved high impact on the increase of 
      knowledge of the anti-vector campaign workers in Mella municipality, Santiago de 
      Cuba province.

AB  - The data deluge in post-genomic era demands development of novel data mining tools. 
      Existing molecular phylogeny analyses (MPAs) developed for individual gene/protein 
      sequences are alignment-based. However, the size of genomic data and uncertainties 
      associated with alignments, necessitate development of alignment-free methods for 
      MPA. Derivation of distances between sequences is an important step in both, 
      alignment-dependant and alignment-free methods. Various alignment-free distance 
      measures based on oligo-nucleotide frequencies, information content, compression 
      techniques, etc. have been proposed. However, these distance measures do not account 
      for relative order of components viz. nucleotides or amino acids. A new distance 
      measure, based on the concept of 'return time distribution' (RTD) of k-mers is 
      proposed, which accounts for the sequence composition and their relative orders. 
      Statistical parameters of RTDs are used to derive a distance function. The resultant 
      distance matrix is used for clustering and phylogeny using Neighbor-joining. Its 
      performance for MPA and subtyping was evaluated using simulated data generated by 
      block-bootstrap, receiver operating characteristics and leave-one-out cross 
      validation methods. The proposed method was successfully applied for MPA of family 
      Flaviviridae and subtyping of Dengue viruses. It is observed that method retains 
      resolution for classification and subtyping of viruses at varying levels of sequence 
      similarity and taxonomic hierarchy.

AB  - Flaviviruses comprise important arthropod-transmitted human pathogens, including 
      yellow fever (YF), dengue (Den), Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile (WN) and 
      tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viruses that have the potential of expanding their 
      endemic areas due to global climatic, ecological and socio-economic changes. While 
      effective vaccines against YF, JE and TBE are in widespread use, the development of 
      a dengue vaccine has been hampered for a long time because of concerns of 
      immunopathological consequences of vaccination. Phase III clinical trials with a 
      recombinant chimeric live vaccine are now ongoing and will show whether the enormous 
      problem of dengue can be resolved or at least reduced by vaccination in the future. 
      Unprecedented details of the flavivirus particle structure have become available 
      through the combined use of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy that 
      led to novel and surprising insights into the antigenic structure of these viruses. 
      Recent studies provided evidence for an important role of virus maturation as well 
      as particle dynamics in virus neutralization by antibodies and thus added previously 
      unknown layers of complexity to our understanding of flavivirus immune protection. 
      This information is invaluable for interpreting current investigations on the 
      functional activities of polyclonal antibody responses to flavivirus infections and 
      vaccinations and may open new avenues for studies on flavivirus cell biology and 
      vaccine design.

AB  - The chemical study of the bark and the wood of Trigonostemon cherrieri, a rare 
      endemic plant of New Caledonia, led to the isolation of a series of highly 
      oxygenated daphnane diterpenoid orthoesters (DDO) bearing an uncommon chlorinated 
      moiety: trigocherrins A-F and trigocherriolides A-D. Herein, we describe the 
      isolation and structure elucidation of the DDO (trigocherrins B-F and 
      trigocherriolides A-D). We also report the antiviral activity of trigocherrins A, B 
      and F (1, 2 and 6) and trigocherriolides A, B and C (7-9) against various emerging 
      pathogens: chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Sindbis virus (SINV), Semliki forest virus 
      (SFV) and dengue virus (DENV).

TI  - Comparison of plaque- and enzyme-linked immunospot-based assays to measure the 
      neutralizing activities of monoclonal antibodies specific to domain III of dengue 
      virus envelope protein.
PG  - 73-8
LID - 10.1128/CVI.05388-11 [doi]
AB  - The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is used widely to measure the 
      neutralization activity of anti-dengue virus (DENV) antibodies, but it is 
      time-consuming and labor-intensive and has low sample throughput. For fast and 
      convenient measurement of neutralizing antibodies, especially in evaluating the 
      efficiency of the DENV vaccines on a large scale, a new method is needed to replace 
      PRNT. In recent decades, several microneutralization assays have been developed to 
      overcome the limitations of PRNT. In the present study, we evaluated one of these, 
      the enzyme-linked immunospot microneutralization test (ELISPOT-MNT), in comparison 
      with PRNT. ELISPOT-MNT is performed in 96-well format, and the plaques are developed 
      after 2 to 4 days using an ELISA to transform them into spots, which are detected 
      automatically with an ELISPOT instrument. The assay is faster than PRNT, has a high 
      throughput, and is more objective. We used 10 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against 
      domain III of the DENV envelope protein (EDIII) to evaluate the two assays; all of 
      these MAbs cross-react with all four serotypes of DENV as measured by 
      immunofluorescence assay. The two neutralization assays were performed 
      simultaneously to measure the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of these MAbs. 
      Using PRNT as the reference and treating IC(50) values higher than 50 μg/ml of MAbs 
      as negative, ELISPOT-MNT showed a sensitivity of 95.6% and specificity of 88.24% 
      when 10 MAbs were tested against four DENV serotype strains. A good correlation 
      (R(2) = 0.672; P = 0.000) was observed between the two assays, making ELISPOT-MNT a 
      potentially valuable method for measure of neutralizing antibodies against DENV.

AB  - PriMux is a new software package for selecting multiplex compatible, degenerate 
      primers and probes to detect diverse targets such as viruses. It requires no 
      multiple sequence alignment, instead applying k-mer algorithms, hence it scales well 
      for large target sets and saves user effort from curating sequences into alignable 
      groups. PriMux has the capability to predict degenerate primers as well as probes 
      suitable for TaqMan or other primer/probe triplet assay formats, or simply probes 
      for microarray or other single-oligo assay formats. PriMux employs suffix array 
      methods for efficient calculations on oligos 10-~100 nt in length. TaqMan® primers 
      and probes for each segment of Rift Valley fever virus were designed using PriMux, 
      and lab testing comparing signatures designed using PriMux versus those designed 
      using traditional methods demonstrated equivalent or better sensitivity for the 
      PriMux-designed signatures compared to traditional signatures. In addition, we used 
      PriMux to design TaqMan® primers and probes for unalignable or poorly alignable 
      groups of targets: that is, all segments of Rift Valley fever virus analyzed as a 
      single target set of 198 sequences, or all 2863 Dengue virus genomes for all four 
      serotypes available at the time of our analysis. The PriMux software is available as 
      open source from http://sourceforge.net/projects/PriMux.

TI  - Comparison of wing geometry data and genetic data for assessing the population 
      structure of Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 591-6
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2011.11.013 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the most important vector of dengue viruses in tropical and 
      subtropical regions. Because vaccines are still under development, dengue prevention 
      depends primarily on vector control. Population genetics is a common approach in 
      research involving Ae. aegypti. In the context of medical entomology, wing 
      morphometric analysis has been proposed as a strong and low-cost complementary tool 
      for investigating population structure. Therefore, we comparatively evaluated the 
      genetic and phenotypic variability of population samples of Ae. aegypti from four 
      sampling sites in the metropolitan area of São Paulo city, Brazil. The distances 
      between the sites ranged from 7.1 to 50 km. This area, where knowledge on the 
      population genetics of this mosquito is incipient, was chosen due to the thousands 
      of dengue cases registered yearly. The analysed loci were polymorphic, and they 
      revealed population structure (global F(ST)=0.062; p<0.05) and low levels of gene 
      flow (Nm=0.47) between the four locations. Principal component and discriminant 
      analyses of wing shape variables (18 landmarks) demonstrated that wing polymorphisms 
      were only slightly more common between populations than within populations. Whereas 
      microsatellites allowed for geographic differentiation, wing geometry failed to 
      distinguish the samples. These data suggest that microevolution in this species may 
      affect genetic and morphological characters to different degrees. In this case, wing 
      shape was not validated as a marker for assessing population structure. According to 
      the interpretation of a previous report, the wing shape of Ae. aegypti does not vary 
      significantly because it is stabilised by selective pressure.

AB  - The structures of two sulfated xylomannans extracted from the red alga Nemalion 
      helminthoides were determined. These two fractions plus a sulfated mannan, isolated 
      from the same alga and whose structure was previously reported, were subjected to 
      chemical modification. The mannan was oversulfated with SO(3)-pyridine in dimethyl 
      sulfoxide at 60 °C during two and three hours and the xylomannans were subjected to 
      Smith degradation in order to eliminate xylose side-chains. Structural analysis of 
      all derivatives was carried out by methylation analysis and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. 
      Antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, and dengue virus type 
      2 of native and modified mannans and xylomannans was estimated. Anticoagulant effect 
      of the active fractions was also determined.

TI  - Evaluation of Melaleuca cajuputi (Family: Myrtaceae) Essential Oil in Aerosol Spray 
      Cans against Dengue Vectors in Low Cost Housing Flats.
PG  - 28-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Melaleuca cajuputi essential oil in aerosol spray was evaluated against 
      the dengue vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus at low cost housing flats in 
      Section 10, Setapak, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. METHODS: ESSENTIAL OIL IN AEROSOL VIZ: 
      5% and 10% of concentrations were sprayed for 5 seconds each towards hung mosquitoes 
      in 5 cylindrical net cages. Aerosol weights were recorded before and after spraying 
      to determine discharge rates. Knockdown and mortality number were observed and 
      compared to MS standard aerosol which contain 0.07% prallethrin and 0.05% 
      d-phenothrin as positive control and aerosol contain 40% kerosene and 60% LPG was 
      used as negative control. RESULTS: High knockdown and mortality was observed in both 
      species of mosquitoes towards MS standard aerosol. There was a significant 
      difference (P< 0.05) of mortality and knockdown between 5% and 10% of essential oil 
      aerosol and 5% and 10% essential oil between MS standard. For 5% essential oil, mean 
      percentage (%) of knockdown and mortality of Ae. aegypti displayed slightly higher 
      compared to Ae. albopictus. Spraying with 5% M. cajuputi essential oil aerosol 
      indicated a knockdown of Ae. aegypti 5.60±1.18 and mortality of 22.90±4.22 while Ae. 
      albopictus showed 4.60±0.89 knockdown and 20.00±2.85 mortality. The 10% essential 
      oil concentration gave 23.60±1.68 knockdown and 48.05±0.37 mortality for Ae. 
      aegypti. Ae. albopictus gave 23.00±3.16 knockdown and 44.20 ± 2.10 mortality 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Extracts of essential oils does possessed an adulticidal 
      effects and could be considered and utilized for future dengue vectors control.

PG  - 97-103
LID - 10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.10.006 [doi]
AB  - The replication of dengue virus (DENV) RNA requires at least two viral 
      non-structural (NS) proteins, NS3 and NS5. To facilitate the study of the DENV 
      replication complex, human monoclonal IgG that are specific for NS proteins have 
      been generated and characterised. The anti-NS3 IgG, 3F8, binds a conserved epitope 
      (aa526-531) in the NS3 helicase domain, and cross-reacts with NS3 from all four DENV 
      serotypes and the related yellow fever virus. The anti-NS2B IgG, 3F10, binds aa49-66 
      of NS2B (CF18), which forms part of the 47 aa hydrophilic cofactor region required 
      for NS3 protease activity. The specificity of the IgG for their respective 
      non-structural proteins has been demonstrated by immunofluorescence of cells 
      infected with DENV and Western blotting. 3F8 is able to co-immunoprecipitate NS3 and 
      NS5 from BHK-21 cells infected with DENV2, and 3F10 is able to detect an interaction 
      between recombinant NS2B(CF18)NS3 full-length protein and the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA 
      polymerase (RdRp) domain in an ELISA-based binding assay. The assay is specific and 
      highly reproducible, with a clear binding curve seen when RdRp is incubated with 
      increasing amounts of full-length NS3, but not the NS3 protease domain. The NS3 
      helicase domain competes with NS3 full-length for NS5 RdRp binding, with a K(d.) of 
      2.5μM. Since NS3 and NS5 are required for DENV replication, this fascile assay could 
      be used to screen for non-nucleoside, allosteric inhibitors that disrupt the 
      interaction between the two proteins.

LID - 628475
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infections are expanding worldwide and, because of the lack of a 
      vaccine, the search for antiviral products is imperative. Four serotypes of DENV are 
      described and they all cause a similar disease outcome. It would be interesting to 
      develop an antiviral product that can interact with all four serotypes, prevent host 
      cell infection and subsequent immune activation. DENV entry is thus an interesting 
      target for antiviral therapy. DENV enters the host cell through receptor-mediated 
      endocytosis. Several cellular receptors have been proposed, and DC-SIGN, present on 
      dendritic cells, is considered as the most important DENV receptor until now. 
      Because DENV entry is a target for antiviral therapy, various classes of compounds 
      have been investigated to inhibit this process. In this paper, an overview is given 
      of all the putative DENV receptors, and the most promising DENV entry inhibitors are 
      discussed.

TI  - Genomic and antigenic characterization of the newly emerging Chinese duck egg-drop 
      syndrome flavivirus: genomic comparison with Tembusu and Sitiawan viruses.
PG  - 2158-2170

AB  - Duck egg-drop syndrome virus (DEDSV) is a newly emerging pathogenic flavivirus 
      causing avian diseases in China. The infection occurs in laying ducks characterized 
      by a severe drop in egg production with a fatality rate of 5-15 %. The virus was 
      found to be most closely related to Tembusu virus (TMUV), an isolate from mosquitoes 
      in South-east Asia. Here, we have sequenced and characterized the full-length 
      genomes of seven DEDSV strains, including the 5'- and 3'-non-coding regions (NCRs). 
      We also report for the first time the ORF sequences of TMUV and Sitiawan virus 
      (STWV), another closely related flavivirus isolated from diseased chickens. We 
      analysed the phylogenetic and antigenic relationships of DEDSV in relation to the 
      Asian viruses TMUV and STWV, and other representative flaviviruses. Our results 
      confirm the close relationship between DEDSV and TMUV/STWV and we discuss their 
      probable evolutionary origins. We have also characterized the cleavage sites, 
      potential glycosylation sites and unique motifs/modules of these viruses. 
      Additionally, conserved sequences in both 5'- and 3'-NCRs were identified and the 
      predicted secondary structures of the terminal sequences were studied. Antigenic 
      cross-reactivity comparisons of DEDSV with related pathogenic flaviviruses 
      identified a surprisingly close relationship with dengue virus (DENV) and raised the 
      question of whether or not DEDSV may have a potential infectious threat to man. 
      Importantly, DEDSV can be efficiently recognized by a broadly cross-reactive 
      flavivirus mAb, 2A10G6, derived against DENV. The significance of these studies is 
      discussed in the context of the emergence, evolution, epidemiology, antigenicity and 
      pathogenicity of the newly emergent DEDSV.

AB  - A series of acylthiourea derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for 
      broad-spectrum antiviral activity with selected viruses from Poxviridae (vaccinia 
      virus) and two different genera of the family Bunyaviridae (Rift Valley fever and La 
      Crosse viruses). A compound selected from a library screen, compound 1, displayed 
      submicromolar antiviral activity against both vaccinia virus (EC(50)=0.25 μM) and La 
      Crosse virus (EC(50)=0.27 μM) in cytopathic effect (CPE) assays. SAR analysis was 
      performed to further improve antiviral potency and to optimize drug-like properties 
      of the initial hits. During our analysis, we identified 26, which was found to be 
      nearly fourfold more potent than 1 against both vaccinia and La Crosse viruses. 
      Selected compounds were further tested to more fully characterize the spectrum of 
      antiviral activity. Many of these possessed single digit micromolar and 
      sub-micromolar antiviral activity against a diverse array of targets, including 
      influenza virus (Orthomyxoviridae), Tacaribe virus (Arenaviridae), and dengue virus 
      (Flaviviridae).

LID - e41635
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common mosquito-borne viral 
      disease threatening human health around the world. Type I interferon (IFN) and 
      cytokine production are crucial in the innate immune system. We previously reported 
      that DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) induced low levels of interferon regulatory factor 3 
      and NF-κB activation, thus leading to reduced production of IFN-β in the early phase 
      of infection. Here, we determined whether DENV infection not only hampers type I IFN 
      activation but also cytokine production triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 
      signaling. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used quantitative RT-PCR and found 
      that only low levels of IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 
      (IL-10), IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA were detected in 
      DENV-2-infected bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells. Furthermore, DENV-2 infection 
      repressed cytokine production triggered by TLR signaling. To elucidate the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying this suppression event, we measured NF-κB activation by p65 
      nuclear translocation and luciferase reporter assay and found that NF-κB activation 
      triggered by TLR ligands was blocked by DENV-2 infection. As well, extracellular 
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity was suppressed by DENV-2 infection. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To downregulate the host innate immunity, DENV-2 by itself 
      is a weak inducer of type I IFN and cytokines, furthermore DENV-2 can also block the 
      TLR-triggered ERK-NF-κB activation and cytokine production.

TI  - Genetic structure and phylogeography of Aedes aegypti, the dengue and yellow-fever 
      mosquito vector in Bolivia.
PG  - 1260-9
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2012.04.012 [doi]
AB  - Between the 16th and 18th centuries, Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae), a mosquito 
      native to Africa, invaded the Americas, where it was successively responsible for 
      the emergence of yellow fever (YF) and dengue (DEN). The species was eradicated from 
      numerous American countries in the mid-20th century, but re-invaded them in the 
      1970s and 1980s. Little is known about the precise identities of Ae. aegypti 
      populations which successively thrived in South America, or their relation with the 
      epidemiological changes in patterns of YF and DEN. We examined these questions in 
      Bolivia, where Ae. aegypti, eradicated in 1943, re-appeared in the 1980s. We 
      assessed the genetic variability and population genetics of Ae. aegypti samples in 
      order to deduce their genetic structure and likely geographic origin. Using a 
      21-population set covering Bolivia, we analyzed the polymorphism at nine 
      microsatellite loci and in two mitochondrial DNA regions (COI and ND4). 
      Microsatellite markers revealed a significant genetic structure among geographic 
      populations (F(ST)=0.0627, P<0.0001) in relation with the recent re-expansion of Ae. 
      aegypti in Bolivia. Analysis of mtDNA sequences revealed the existence of two 
      genetic lineages, one dominant lineage recovered throughout Bolivia, and the second 
      restricted to rural localities in South Bolivia. Phylogenic analysis indicated that 
      this minority lineage was related to West African Ae. aegypti specimens. In 
      conclusion, our results suggested a temporal succession of Ae. aegypti populations 
      in Bolivia, that potentially impacted the epidemiology of dengue and yellow fever.

      Escherichia coli.

AB  - Bacterial lipoproteins are crucial antigens for protective immunity against 
      bacterial pathogens. Expression of exogenous lipoproteins in Escherichia coli at 
      high levels is thought to be an extremely difficult endeavor because it frequently 
      results in incomplete or absent lipid modification. Previously, we identified a 
      fusion sequence (D1) from a Neisseria meningitidis lipoprotein that induced a 
      non-lipidated protein, E3 (the domain III of the dengue virus envelope protein), to 
      become lipidated. However, without optimizing the growth conditions, some of the 
      D1-fusion proteins were not lipidated. Here, we report the influence of medium 
      components on the expression of recombinant lipoproteins in E. coli. For high-level 
      expression of mature lipoproteins in the C43 (DE3) strain, M9 medium was better than 
      M63 and the rich medium. Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of other media 
      factors (including nitrogen and carbon sources, phosphate, ferrous ions, calcium, 
      magnesium, and pH) on the levels of lipoprotein expression. The results showed that 
      excess nitrogen sources and phosphate in M9 medium could increase the amount of 
      immature lipoproteins, and glucose was a better carbon source than glycerol for 
      expressing mature lipoproteins. We also found that lipoproteins tended to be 
      completely processed in the alkaline environment, even in the nutrient-rich medium. 
      Additional constructs expressing different immunogens or lipid signal peptides as 
      targets were also utilized, demonstrating that these targets could be expressed as 
      completely mature lipoproteins in the M9 medium but not in the rich medium. Our 
      results provide the useful information for expressing mature exogenous lipoproteins 
      in E. coli.

TI  - Strain Variation in the Transcriptome of the Dengue Fever Vector, Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 103-14
LID - 10.1534/g3.111.001107 [doi]
AB  - Studies of transcriptome dynamics provide a basis for understanding functional 
      elements of the genome and the complexity of gene regulation. The dengue vector 
      mosquito, Aedes aegypti, exhibits great adaptability to diverse ecological 
      conditions, is phenotypically polymorphic, and shows variation in vectorial capacity 
      to arboviruses. Previous genome sequencing showed richness in repetitive DNA and 
      transposable elements that can contribute to genome plasticity. Population genetic 
      studies revealed a varying degree of worldwide genetic polymorphism. However, the 
      extent of functional genetic polymorphism across strains is unknown. The 
      transcriptomes of three Ae. aegypti strains, Chetumal (CTM), Rexville D-Puerto Rico 
      (Rex-D) and Liverpool (LVP), were compared. CTM is more susceptible than Rex- D to 
      infection by dengue virus serotype 2. A total of 4188 transcripts exhibit either no 
      or small variation (<2-fold) among sugar-fed samples of the three strains and 
      between sugar- and blood-fed samples within each strain, corresponding most likely 
      to genes encoding products necessary for vital functions. Transcripts enriched in 
      blood-fed mosquitoes encode proteins associated with catalytic activities, molecular 
      transport, metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and amino acids, and functions 
      related to blood digestion and the progression of the gonotropic cycle. Significant 
      qualitative and quantitative differences were found in individual transcripts among 
      strains including differential representation of paralogous gene products. The 
      majority of immunity-associated transcripts decreased in accumulation after a 
      bloodmeal and the results are discussed in relation to the different susceptibility 
      of CTM and Rex-D mosquitoes to DENV2 infection.

PG  - 503-9
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.07.003 [doi]
AB  - The bio-efficacy of Aloe vera leaf extract and bacterial insecticide, Bacillus 
      sphaericus larvicidal activity was assessed against the first to fourth instars 
      larvae of Aedes aegypti, under the laboratory conditions. The plant material was 
      shade dried at room temperature and powdered coarsely. A. vera and B. sphaericus 
      show varied degrees of larvicidal activity against various instars larvae of A. 
      aegypti. The LC50 of A. vera against the first to fourth instars larvae were 162.74, 
      201.43, 253.30 and 300.05 ppm and the LC90 442.98, 518.86, 563.18 and 612.96 ppm, 
      respectively. B. sphaericus against the first to fourth instars larvae the LC50 
      values were 68.21, 79.13, 93.48, and 107.05 ppm and the LC90 values 149.15, 164.67, 
      183.84, and 201.09 ppm, respectively. However, the combined treatment of A. 
      vera + B. sphaericus (1:2) material shows highest larvicidal activity of the LC50 
      values 54.80, 63.11, 74.66 and 95.10 ppm; The LC90 values of 145.29, 160.14, 179.74 
      and 209.98 ppm, against A. aegypti in all the tested concentrations than the 
      individuals and clearly established that there is a substantial amount of synergist 
      act. The present investigation clearly exhibits that both A. vera and B. sphaericus 
      materials could serve as a potential larvicidal agent. Since, A. aegypti is a 
      container breeder vector mosquito this user and eco-friendly and low-cost vector 
      control strategy could be a viable solution to the existing dengue disease burden. 
      Therefore, this study provides first report on the mosquito larvicidal activity the 
      combined effect of A. vera leaf extract and B. sphaericus against as target species 
      of A. aegypti.

TI  - Mechanistic study of broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against dengue 
      virus that target the fusion loop.

LID - 10.1128/JVI.02273-12 [doi]
AB  - There are no available vaccines for dengue, the most important mosquito-transmitted 
      viral disease. Mechanistic studies with anti-dengue virus (DENV) human monoclonal 
      antibodies (hMAbs) provide a rational approach to identify and characterize 
      neutralizing epitopes on DENV structural proteins that can serve to inform vaccine 
      strategies. Here, we report a class of hMAbs that is likely to be an important 
      determinant in the human humoral response to DENV infection. In this study, we 
      identified and characterized three broadly neutralizing anti-DENV hMAbs: 4.8A, D11C, 
      and 1.6D. These antibodies were isolated from three different convalescent patients 
      with distinct histories of DENV infection yet demonstrated remarkable similarities. 
      All three hMAbs recognized the E glycoprotein with high affinity, neutralized all 
      four serotypes of DENV, and mediated antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in 
      Fc receptor-bearing cells at subneutralizing concentrations. The neutralization 
      activities of these hMAbs correlated with a strong inhibition of virus-liposome and 
      intracellular fusion, not virus-cell binding. We mapped epitopes of these antibodies 
      to the highly conserved fusion loop region of E domain II. Mutations at fusion loop 
      residues W101, L107, and/or G109 significantly reduced the binding of the hMAbs to E 
      protein. The results show that hMAbs directed against the highly conserved E protein 
      fusion loop block viral entry downstream of virus-cell binding by inhibiting E 
      protein-mediated fusion. Characterization of hMAbs targeting this region may provide 
      new insights into DENV vaccine and therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Dengue virus is an emerging infectious agent that infects an estimated 50-100 
      million people annually worldwide, yet current diagnostic practices cannot detect an 
      etiologic pathogen in ∼40% of dengue-like illnesses. Metagenomic approaches to 
      pathogen detection, such as viral microarrays and deep sequencing, are promising 
      tools to address emerging and non-diagnosable disease challenges. In this study, we 
      used the Virochip microarray and deep sequencing to characterize the spectrum of 
      viruses present in human sera from 123 Nicaraguan patients presenting with 
      dengue-like symptoms but testing negative for dengue virus. We utilized a barcoding 
      strategy to simultaneously deep sequence multiple serum specimens, generating on 
      average over 1 million reads per sample. We then implemented a stepwise 
      bioinformatic filtering pipeline to remove the majority of human and low-quality 
      sequences to improve the speed and accuracy of subsequent unbiased database 
      searches. By deep sequencing, we were able to detect virus sequence in 37% (45/123) 
      of previously negative cases. These included 13 cases with Human Herpesvirus 6 
      sequences. Other samples contained sequences with similarity to sequences from 
      viruses in the Herpesviridae, Flaviviridae, Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, 
      Asfarviridae, and Parvoviridae families. In some cases, the putative viral sequences 
      were virtually identical to known viruses, and in others they diverged, suggesting 
      that they may derive from novel viruses. These results demonstrate the utility of 
      unbiased metagenomic approaches in the detection of known and divergent viruses in 
      the study of tropical febrile illness.

LID - 78
AB  - Activated B cells proliferate and differentiate into antibody-producing cells, 
      long-lived plasma cells, and memory B cells after immunization or infection. 
      Repeated encounter of the same antigen triggers the rapid re-activation of 
      pre-existing specific memory B cells, which then potentially enter new germinal 
      center reactions and differentiate into short-lived plasmablasts or remain in the 
      system as memory B cells. Short-lived class-switched IgG and IgA plasmablasts appear 
      in the circulation transiently and the frequency of these cells can be remarkably 
      high. The specificities and affinities of single plasmablasts in humans have been 
      reported for several viral infections, so far most extensively for influenza and 
      HIV. In general, the immunoglobulin variable regions of plasmablasts are highly 
      mutated and diverse, suggesting that plasmablasts are derived from memory B cells, 
      yet it is unclear which memory B cell subsets are activated and whether activated 
      memory B cells adapt or mature before differentiation. This review summarizes what 
      is known about the phenotype and the origin of human plasmablasts in the context of 
      viral infections and whether these cells can be predictors of long-lived immunity.

TI  - Proteome of Aedes aegypti in response to infection and coinfection with 
      microsporidian parasites.
PG  - 681-94
LID - 10.1002/ece3.199 [doi]
AB  - Hosts are frequently infected with more than one parasite or pathogen at any one 
      time, but little is known as to how they respond to multiple immune challenges 
      compared to those involving single infections. We investigated the proteome of Aedes 
      aegypti larvae following infection with either Edhazardia aedis or Vavraia culicis, 
      and coinfections involving both. They are both obligate intracellular parasites 
      belonging to the phylum microsporidia and infect natural populations of Ae. aegypti. 
      The results found some proteins only showing modified abundance in response to 
      infections involving E. aedis, while others were only differentially abundant when 
      infections involved V. culicis. Some proteins only responded with modified abundance 
      to the coinfection condition, while others were differentially abundant in response 
      to all three types of infection. As time since infection increased, the response to 
      each of the single parasite infections diverged, while the response to the E. aedis 
      and coinfection treatments converged. Some of the proteins differentially abundant 
      in response to infection were identified. They included two vacuolar ATPases, 
      proteins known to have a role in determining the infection success of intracellular 
      parasites. This result suggests microsporidia could influence the infection success 
      of other intracellular pathogens infecting vector species of mosquito, including 
      viruses, Plasmodium and Wolbachia.

TI  - Ivermectin is a potent inhibitor of flavivirus replication specifically targeting 
      NS3 helicase activity: new prospects for an old drug.
PG  - 1884-94
LID - 10.1093/jac/dks147 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infection with yellow fever virus (YFV), the prototypic mosquito-borne 
      flavivirus, causes severe febrile disease with haemorrhage, multi-organ failure and 
      a high mortality. Moreover, in recent years the Flavivirus genus has gained further 
      attention due to re-emergence and increasing incidence of West Nile, dengue and 
      Japanese encephalitis viruses. Potent and safe antivirals are urgently needed. 
      METHODS: Starting from the crystal structure of the NS3 helicase from Kunjin virus 
      (an Australian variant of West Nile virus), we identified a novel, unexploited 
      protein site that might be involved in the helicase catalytic cycle and could thus 
      in principle be targeted for enzyme inhibition. In silico docking of a library of 
      small molecules allowed us to identify a few selected compounds with high predicted 
      affinity for the new site. Their activity against helicases from several 
      flaviviruses was confirmed in in vitro helicase/enzymatic assays. The effect on the 
      in vitro replication of flaviviruses was then evaluated. RESULTS: Ivermectin, a 
      broadly used anti-helminthic drug, proved to be a highly potent inhibitor of YFV 
      replication (EC₅₀ values in the sub-nanomolar range). Moreover, ivermectin 
      inhibited, although less efficiently, the replication of several other flaviviruses, 
      i.e. dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. 
      Ivermectin exerts its effect at a timepoint that coincides with the onset of 
      intracellular viral RNA synthesis, as expected for a molecule that specifically 
      targets the viral helicase. CONCLUSIONS: The well-tolerated drug ivermectin may hold 
      great potential for treatment of YFV infections. Furthermore, structure-based 
      optimization may result in analogues exerting potent activity against flaviviruses 
      other than YFV.

AB  - Aedes aegypti transmits the viruses that cause yellow and dengue fevers. Vector 
      control is essential, since a vaccine for dengue has not as yet been made available. 
      This work reports on the larvicidal activity of Myracrodruon urundeuva leaf lectin 
      (MuLL) against A. aegypti fourth-stage larvae (L(4)). Also, the resistance of MuLL 
      to digestion by L(4) gut proteases and the effects of MuLL on protease, trypsin-like 
      and α-amylase activities from L(4) gut were evaluated to determine if lectin remains 
      active in A. aegypti gut and if insect enzyme activities can be modulated by MuLL. 
      MuLL promoted mortality of L(4) with LC(50) of 0.202 mg/ml. Haemagglutinating 
      activity of MuLL was detected even after incubation for 96 h with L(4) gut 
      preparation containing protease activity. MuLL affected the activity of gut enzymes, 
      inhibiting protease and trypsin activities and stimulating α-amylase activity. The 
      results suggest that MuLL may become a new biodegradable larvicidal agent for dengue 
      control. Larvicidal activity of MuLL may be linked to its resistance to proteolysis 
      by larval enzymes and interference in the activity of digestive larval enzymes.

AB  - We established a continuous cell line from the embryo of the mosquito Culex 
      tritaeniorhynchus Giles (Diptera: Culicidae), a known major vector of the Japanese 
      encephalitis virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) in Asia. The cell line, 
      designated NIID-CTR, was serially subcultured in VP-12 medium supplemented with 10 % 
      heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). It continued to grow for more than 60 
      passages over a 750-d period. The NIID-CTR cell line mainly comprised two 
      morphologically distinct types of cells with adhesive properties: spindle-shaped and 
      round cells. Most of the NIID-CTR cells at the 45th passage were diploid (2n = 6). 
      The growth kinetics of the NIID-CTR cells was significantly affected by the FBS 
      concentration in the medium. The population doubling time of the NIID-CTR cells was 
      20 h in the presence of 10 % FBS and 76 h in its absence. The DNA sequence of the 
      mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene confirmed that the NIID-CTR cell line was 
      derived from C. tritaeniorhynchus. The cells were highly susceptible to Japanese 
      encephalitis and Dengue viruses, thus providing a valuable tool for the study of 
      mosquito-borne flaviviruses.

AB  - In an effort to identify novel inhibitors of Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Dengue (DENV) 
      virus replication, a systematic study with 820 ethyl acetate extracts of Madagascan 
      plants was performed in a virus-cell-based assay for CHIKV and a DENV NS5 
      RNA-dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp) assay. The extract obtained from the leaves of 
      Anacolosa pervilleana was selected for its significant activity in both assays. One 
      new (E)-tridec-2-en-4-ynedioic acid named anacolosine (1), together with three known 
      acetylenic acids, the octadeca-9,11,13-triynoic acid (2), 
      (13E)-octadec-13-en-9,11-diynoic acid (3), (13E)-octadec-13-en-11-ynoic acid (4), 
      two terpenoids, lupenone (5) and β-amyrone (6), and one cyanogenic glycoside, 
      (S)-sambunigrin (7) were isolated. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive 
      analyses of NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry data. The inhibitory potency of 
      these compounds was evaluated on CHIKV, DENV RdRp and West-Nile polymerase virus 
      (WNV RdRp). Both terpenoids showed a moderate activity against CHIKV (EC(50) 77 and 
      86 μM, respectively) and the acetylenic acids produced IC(50) values around 3 μM in 
      the DENV RdRp assay.

AB  - In an effort to identify novel inhibitors of chikungunya (CHIKV) and dengue (DENV) 
      virus replication, a systematic study with 820 ethyl acetate extracts of madagascan 
      plants was performed in a virus-cell-based assay for CHIKV, and a DENV NS5

      of Flacourtia ramontchi was selected for its significant activity in both assays. 
      Six new phenolic glycosides, named flacourtosides A-F (1-6), phenolic glycosides 
      itoside H, xylosmin, scolochinenoside D, and poliothrysoside, and betulinic acid 
      3β-caffeate were obtained using the bioassay-guided isolation process. Their 
      structures were elucidated by comprehensive analyses of NMR spectroscopic and mass 
      spectrometric data. Even though several extracts and fractions showed significant 
      selective antiviral activity in the CHIKV virus-cell-based assay, none of the 
      purified compounds did. However, in the DENV RNA polymerase assay, significant 
      inhibition was observed with betulinic acid 3β-caffeate (IC(50) = 0.85 ± 0.1 μM) and 
      to a lesser extent for the flacourtosides A and E (1 and 5, respectively), and 
      scolochinenoside D (IC(50) values ~10 μM).

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected around 160 million individuals. Current 
      therapies have limited efficacy and are fraught with side effects. To identify 
      cellular HCV dependency factors, possible therapeutic targets, we manipulated 
      signaling cascades with pathway-specific inhibitors. Using this approach we 
      identified the MAPK/ERK regulated, cytosolic, calcium-dependent, group IVA 
      phospholipase A2 (PLA2G4A) as a novel HCV dependency factor. Inhibition of PLA2G4A 
      activity reduced core protein abundance at lipid droplets, core envelopment and 
      secretion of particles. Moreover, released particles displayed aberrant protein 
      composition and were 100-fold less infectious. Exogenous addition of arachidonic 
      acid, the cleavage product of PLA2G4A-catalyzed lipolysis, but not other related 
      poly-unsaturated fatty acids restored infectivity. Strikingly, production of 
      infectious Dengue virus, a relative of HCV, was also dependent on PLA2G4A. These 
      results highlight previously unrecognized parallels in the assembly pathways of 
      these human pathogens, and define PLA2G4A-dependent lipolysis as crucial 
      prerequisite for production of highly infectious viral progeny.

AB  - Flaviviruses, including Dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and Tick-borne 
      encephalitis virus, are major emerging human pathogens, affecting millions of 
      individuals worldwide. Many clinically important flaviviruses elicit CNS diseases in 
      infected hosts, including traditional "hemorrhagic" viruses, such as Dengue. This 
      review focuses on the epidemiology, symptomatology, neuropathology, and, 
      specifically, neuropathogenesis of flavivirus-induced human CNS disease. A detailed 
      insight into specific factors priming towards neuroinvasive disease is of clear 
      clinical significance, as well as importance to the development of antiviral 
      therapies and identification of key mechanisms involved in the (re)emergence of 
      specific flaviviruses, including potentially novel or previously unrecognized ones, 
      as neuroinvasive pathogens.

PG  - 411-40
LID - 10.1146/annurev-pathol-020712-164041 [doi]
AB  - Four families of enveloped RNA viruses, filoviruses, flaviviruses, arenaviruses, and 
      bunyaviruses, cause hemorrhagic fevers. These viruses are maintained in specific 
      natural cycles involving nonhuman primates, bats, rodents, domestic ruminants, 
      humans, mosquitoes, and ticks. Vascular instability varies from mild to fatal shock, 
      and hemorrhage ranges from none to life threatening. The pathogenic mechanisms are 
      extremely diverse and include deficiency of hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors 
      owing to hepatocellular necrosis, cytokine storm, increased permeability by vascular 
      endothelial growth factor, complement activation, and disseminated intravascular 
      coagulation in one or more hemorrhagic fevers. The severity of disease caused by 
      these agents varies tremendously; there are extremely high fatality rates in Ebola 
      and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, and asymptomatic infection predominates in yellow 
      fever and dengue viral infections. Although ineffective immunity and high viral 
      loads are characteristic of several viral hemorrhagic fevers, severe plasma leakage 
      occurs at the time of viral clearance and defervescence in dengue hemorrhagic fever.

TI  - Nuclear trafficking of proteins from RNA viruses: potential target for antivirals?
PG  - 202-6
LID - 10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.06.008 [doi]
AB  - A key aspect of the infectious cycle of many viruses is the transport of specific 
      viral proteins into the host cell nucleus to perturb the antiviral response. 
      Examples include a number of RNA viruses that are significant human pathogens, such 
      as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, influenza A, dengue, respiratory syncytial 
      virus and rabies, as well agents that predominantly infect livestock, such as Rift 
      valley fever virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Inhibiting the nuclear 
      trafficking of viral proteins as a therapeutic strategy offers an attractive 
      possibility, with important recent progress having been made with respect to HIV-1 
      and dengue. The results validate nuclear protein import as an antiviral target, and 
      suggest the identification and development of nuclear transport inhibitors as a 
      viable therapeutic approach for a range of human and zoonotic pathogenic viruses.

TI  - Mosquitocidal activity of Solanum xanthocarpum fruit extract and copepod Mesocyclops 
      thermocyclopoides for the control of dengue vector Aedes aegypti.

AB  - The present study was carried out on Solanum xanthocarpum fruit extract and copepods 
      Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides, which were assessed for the control of dengue vector, 
      Aedes aegypti, under laboratory conditions. The medicinal plants were collected from 
      the outskirts of Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. The 
      shade-dried fruit materials were extracted by employing the Soxhlet apparatus with 
      methanol (organic solvent) 8 h and the extracts were filtered through a Buchner 
      funnel with Whatman number 1 filter paper. The fruit extracts were concentrated at 
      reduced temperature on a rotary vacuum evaporator and stored at a temperature of 
      4°C. S. xanthocarpum fruit extract (SXFE) at 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 ppm caused 
      significant mortality of Ae. aegypti. The LC(50) and LC(90) of S. xanthocarpum 
      against the first to fourth instar larvae and pupae were 170.91, 195.07, 221.45, 
      253.18, and 279.52 ppm and 320.62, 366.48, 410.20, 435.16, and 462.10 ppm, 
      respectively. A study was conducted to test whether the predatory efficiency of 
      copepods on first instars changed in the presence of SXFE. The percentage of 
      predatory efficiency of copepod was 6.5 % in treatments without SFXE and the 
      percentage of predatory efficiency increased up to 8.7 % when copepods were combined 
      with SFXE. This increase in predation efficiency may be caused by detrimental 
      effects of the SFXE active principle compound (solanocarpine and solanocarpidine) on 
      the mosquito larvae. Repeated application of fruit extract of S. xanthocarpum does 
      not cause changes in copepod populations because fruit extract is highly degradable 
      in the environment. Therefore, the present investigation clearly exhibits that the 
      fruit extract of S. xanthocarpum and copepod M. thermocyclopoides could serve as a 
      potential of highest mortality rate against the mosquito larvae under laboratory 
      conditions. This is a new eco-friendly approach for the control of Ae. aegypti 
      mosquito as target species. Therefore, this study provides the first report on the 
      combined effect of mosquitocidal activity of this fruit extract and copepods of M. 
      thermocyclopoides against dengue vector Ae. aegypti from India.

AB  - Human populations throughout much of the world are experiencing unprecedented 
      changes in their relationship to the environment and their interactions with the 
      animals with which so many humans are intimately dependent upon. These changes 
      result not only from human induced changes in the climate, but also from population 
      demographic changes due to wars, social unrest, behavioral changes resulting from 
      cultural mixing, and large changes in land-use practices. Each of these social 
      shifts can affect the maintenance and emergence of arthropod vectors disease or the 
      pathogenic organisms themselves. A good example is the country of Pakistan, with a 
      large rural population and developing urban economy, it also maintains a wide 
      diversity of entomological disease vectors, including biting flies, mosquitoes, and 
      ticks. Pathogens endemic to the region include the agents of piroplasmosis, 
      rickettsiosis, spirochetosis, and viral hemorrhagic fevers and encephalitis. The 
      northwestern region of the country, including the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK), 
      formerly the North-West Frontier Provence (NWFP), and the Federally Administered 
      Tribal Areas (FATA) are mountainous regions with a high degree of habitat diversity 
      that has recently undergone a massive increase in human population density due to an 
      immigrating refugee population from neighboring war-torn Afghanistan. Vector-borne 
      diseases in people and livestock are common in KPK and FATA regions due to the 
      limited use of vector control measures and access to livestock vaccines. The vast 
      majority of people in this region live in abject poverty with >70% of the population 
      living directly from production gained in animal husbandry. In many instances whole 
      families live directly alongside their animal counterparts. In addition, there is 
      little to no awareness of the threat posed by ticks and transmission of either 
      zoonotic or veterinary pathogens. Recent emergence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic 
      fever virus in rural populations, outbreaks of Dengue hemorrhagic fever have been 
      reported in the region, and high prevalence of cattle infected and co-infected with 
      multiple species of hemoparasites (Theileria, Babesia, Anaplasma). The emergence of 
      which has followed the increased density of the rural population due to an influx of 
      refugees from violent conflicts in Afghanistan and is exacerbated by an already 
      impoverished society and wide diversity of potential arthropod vectors. These human 
      outbreaks may be exacerbated by episodes of social upheaval but are also tied to the 
      historically close association of people in the region with their livestock and 
      subsequent zoonosis that result from spillover from co-habitation with infected 
      domestic animals.

LID - 10.1016/S2221-1691(12)60099-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the larvicidal activity of the seagrass extracts. METHODS: 
      Seagrass extracts, Syringodium isoetifolium (S. isoetifolium), Cymodocea serrulata 
      and Halophila beccarii, were dissolved in DMSO to prepare a graded series of 
      concentration. Batches of 25 early 4th instars larvae of Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) 
      were transferred to 250 mL enamel bowl containing 199 mL of distilled water and 1 mL 
      of plant extracts (0.01 mg - 0.1 mg). After 24 h the mortality rate was identified 
      with the formulae [(% of test mortality - % of control mortality)/(100 - % of 
      control mortality)] × 100. Each experiment was conducted with three replicates and a 
      concurrent control group. A control group consisted of 1 mL of DMSO and 199 mL of 
      distilled water only. RESULTS: : The root extract of S. isoetifolium showed maximum 
      larvicidal activity with minimum concentration of extract of LC50= 0.0 604 ± 
      0.0 040)µg/mL with lower confidence limit (LCL) - upper confidence limit (UCL) = 
      (0.051-0.071) and LC90=0.0 972µg/mL followed by leaf extract of S. isoetifolium 
      showed LC50= (0.062 ± 0.005)µg/mL. The regression equation of root and leaf extract 
      of S. isoetifolium for 4th instar larvae were Y= 4.909 + 1.32x (R(2)= 0.909) and Y= 
      2.066 + 1.21x (R(2) =0.897) respectively. The results of the preliminary 
      phytochemical constituents shows the presence of saponin, steroids, terpenoid, 
      phenols, protein and sugars. CONCLUSIONS: From the present study the ethanolic 
      extracts of seagrass of S. isoetifolium possesses lead compound for development of 
      larvicidal activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (M. 
      anisopliae) in the local environment, and evaluate its efficacy against the 
      suspected dengue vector Aedes albopictus in Pakistan. METHODS: According to the 
      standard procedure, M. anisopliae was isolated from the dead mosquitoes which were 
      collected from the field or dead after the collection. Bioassay was performed to 
      determine its efficacy. RESULTS: The results indicated that M. anisopliae had 
      larvicidal effect with LC50 value 1.09×10(5) and LC90 value 1.90×10(13) while it 
      took 45.41 h to kill 50% of tested population. CONCLUSIONS: Taking long time to kill 
      50% population when compare with the synthetic insecticides, is the only drawback 
      for the use of entomopathogenic fungus but these bio-pesticides are safe for the 
      use.

TI  - West nile virus disease and other arboviral diseases - United States, 2011.
PG  - 510-4
AB  - Arthropodborne viruses (arboviruses) are transmitted to humans primarily through the 
      bites of infected mosquitoes and ticks. Symptomatic infections most often manifest 
      as a systemic febrile illness and, less commonly, as neuroinvasive disease (e.g., 
      meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis). West Nile virus (WNV) is the 
      leading cause of domestically acquired arboviral disease in the United States. 
      However, several other arboviruses also cause seasonal outbreaks and sporadic cases. 
      In 2011, CDC received reports of 871 cases of nationally notifiable arboviral 
      diseases (excluding dengue); etiological agents included WNV (712 cases), La Crosse 
      virus (LACV) (130), Powassan virus (POWV) (16), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) 
      (six), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) (four), and Jamestown Canyon virus 
      (JCV) (three). Of these, 624 (72%) were classified as neuroinvasive disease, for a 
      national incidence of 0.20 per 100,000 population. WNV and other arboviruses 
      continue to cause focal outbreaks and severe illness in substantial numbers of 
      persons in the United States.

TI  - Discriminating lethal concentrations and efficacy of six pyrethroids for control of 
      Aedes aegypti in Thailand.
PG  - 30-7
AB  - Establishing baseline insecticide discriminating doses is crucial in accurately 
      determining susceptibility status and changing temporal patterns of physiological 
      response in mosquito populations. Pyrethroids are the predominant chemicals used for 
      controlling adult Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, both vectors of dengue viruses, 
      in Thailand. Presently, only 2 pyrethroids, permethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, have 
      published diagnostic dose rates for monitoring Ae. aegypti. This study established 
      the diagnostic lethal concentrations for 6 different pyrethroids available in 
      Thailand for dengue vector control. United States Department of Agriculture 
      insecticide-susceptible strain of Ae. aegypti was used to establish the baseline 
      concentrations for subsequent susceptibility testing of field populations. Our 
      findings showed lower discriminating concentrations for lambda-cyhalothrin and 
      permethrin than those recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), at 2.5- 
      and 1.7-fold lower dosing, respectively. The susceptibility status of 3 different 
      geographical populations of field-collected Ae. aegypti were tested using the 
      standard WHO procedures. All 3 field strains demonstrated varying levels of 
      physiological resistance to each compound. We conclude that establishing the 
      baseline diagnostic concentration of an insecticide is of paramount importance in 
      accurately determining the susceptibility status in field-collected mosquitoes. If 
      possible, discriminating doses should be established for all insecticides and test 
      assays run concurrently with a known susceptible strain for more accurate monitoring 
      of resistance in mosquito populations in Thailand.

      in Acute Viral Encephalitis.

AB  - Acute viral encephalitis caused by neurotrophic viruses, such as mosquito-borne 
      flaviviruses, is an emerging and re-emerging disease that represents an immense 
      global health problem. Considerable progression has been made in understanding the 
      pathogenesis of acute viral encephalitis, but the immune-pathological processes 
      occurring during the progression of encephalitis and the roles played by various 
      molecules and cellular components of the innate and adaptive systems still remain 
      undefined. Recent findings reveal the significant contribution of Toll-like 
      receptors (TLRs) and regulatory CD4(+) T cells in the outcomes of infectious 
      diseases caused by neurotrophic viruses. In this review, we discuss the ample 
      evidence focused on the roles of TLRs and CD4(+) helper T cell subsets on the 
      progression of acute viral encephalitis. Finally, we draw attention to the 
      importance of these molecules and cellular components in defining the pathogenesis 
      of acute viral encephalitis, thereby providing new therapeutic avenues for this 
      disease.

AB  - Nucleic acid detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is invaluable for the 
      detection of dilute and rare sequences, including pathogens and infrequent species 
      in complex clinical and environmental backgrounds. The presence of excess complex 
      background nucleic acid can reduce sensitivity and specificity. This is because 
      mispriming can cause failure of the amplification reaction. Here we describe a new 
      approach to ultrasensitive PCR detection, using enrichment of rare target nucleic 
      acid from abundant background by combining the classic technique of 
      cot-rehybridization to convert the abundant background to double-stranded form, with 
      the use of a newly described, highly processive duplex-specific crab nuclease. We 
      show that trace sequences in a vast excess of background DNA can be undetectable by 
      PCR, independent of the amount of the mixture added to the PCR, and that these 
      sequences can be made detectable by background suppression using this method.

TI  - [Sterile insect technique: targeted control without insecticide].
PG  - 60-2
AB  - Sterile insect technique (SIT) is a method of disease vector control technique that 
      consists of releasing overwhelming numbers of sterile males. This method provides an 
      environmentally friendly alternative to insecticides. Another advantage of SIT in 
      comparison with other methods is to provide a targeted species-specific approach. In 
      Reunion Island, SIT has been proposed as a basis for developing a viable method of 
      vector control against Aedes albopictus and Anopheles arabiensis. The technique has 
      already been successfully tested on fly and mosquito species for more than 40 years. 
      The CRVOI (Centre de Recherche et de Veille sur les Maladies Emergentes dans l'Océan 
      Indien) is carrying out studies to determine the feasibility of SIT for control of 
      Anopheles arabiensis (vector of malaria) and Aedes albopictus (vector of chikungunya 
      and dengue) on Reunion Island and other islands in the Indian Ocean region.

TI  - Model membrane platforms for biomedicine: case study on antiviral drug development.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1007/s13758-011-0018-2 [doi]
LID - 18
AB  - As one of the most important interfaces in cellular systems, biological membranes 
      have essential functions in many activities such as cellular protection and 
      signaling. Beyond their direct functions, they also serve as scaffolds to support 
      the association of proteins involved in structural support, adhesion, and transport. 
      Unfortunately, biological processes sometimes malfunction and require therapeutic 
      intervention. For those processes which occur within or upon membranes, it is 
      oftentimes difficult to study the mechanism in a biologically relevant, membranous 
      environment. Therefore, the identification of direct therapeutic targets is 
      challenging. In order to overcome this barrier, engineering strategies offer a new 
      approach to interrogate biological activities at membrane interfaces by analyzing 
      them through the principles of the interfacial sciences. Since membranes are complex 
      biological interfaces, the development of simplified model systems which mimic 
      important properties of membranes can enable fundamental characterization of 
      interaction parameters for such processes. We have selected the hepatitis C virus 
      (HCV) as a model viral pathogen to demonstrate how model membrane platforms can aid 
      antiviral drug discovery and development. Responsible for generating the genomic 
      diversity that makes treating HCV infection so difficult, viral replication 
      represents an ideal step in the virus life cycle for therapeutic intervention. To 
      target HCV genome replication, the interaction of viral proteins with model membrane 
      platforms has served as a useful strategy for target identification and 
      characterization. In this review article, we demonstrate how engineering approaches 
      have led to the discovery of a new functional activity encoded within the HCV 
      nonstructural 5A protein. Specifically, its N-terminal amphipathic, α-helix (AH) can 
      rupture lipid vesicles in a size-dependent manner. While this activity has a number 
      of exciting biotechnology and biomedical applications, arguably the most promising 
      one is in antiviral medicine. Based on the similarities between lipid vesicles and 
      the lipid envelopes of virus particles, experimental findings from model membrane 
      platforms led to the prediction that a range of medically important viruses might be 
      susceptible to rupturing treatment with synthetic AH peptide. This hypothesis was 
      tested and validated by molecular virology studies. Broad-spectrum antiviral 
      activity of the AH peptide has been identified against HCV, HIV, herpes simplex 
      virus, and dengue virus, and many more deadly pathogens. As a result, the AH peptide 
      is the first in class of broad-spectrum, lipid envelope-rupturing antiviral agents, 
      and has entered the drug pipeline. In summary, engineering strategies break down 
      complex biological systems into simplified biomimetic models that recapitulate the 
      most important parameters. This approach is particularly advantageous for 
      membrane-associated biological processes because model membrane platforms provide 
      more direct characterization of target interactions than is possible with other 
      methods. Consequently, model membrane platforms hold great promise for solving 
      important biomedical problems and speeding up the translation of biological 
      knowledge into clinical applications.

TI  - Study on the correlation of premises condition index and the presence of larvae of 
      aedes species mosquitoes in human dwellings of the cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, 
      India.

AB  - CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that this study helps in conducting rapid survey to 
      identify the presence of Aedes larvae with a minimum number of staff for both 
      inspection and treatment of Aedes larvae during the epidemic situation. OBJECTIVES: 
      To predict dwellings for the presence of Aedes larvae rapidly based on Premises 
      Condition Index (PCI) factors, we studied the possible presence of Aedes species 
      mosquitoes larvae among houses in the Chidambaram urban of Cuddalore District in 
      Tamil Nadu, India based on the scores of variables in PCI, namely House, Yard and 
      degree of shadow. Data of these variables were collected in September and October 
      2006 from 1813 houses in the Chidambaram urban area during the intensive vector 
      control activities employed for the prevention and control of Chikungunya. METHODS: 
      The association between presence of larvae and the variables of PCI was tested by 
      Chi-square and Correlation. The predictability of the presence of Aedes larvae based 
      on PCI factors was computed by logistic regression. RESULTS: The study shows 301 
      containers in 132 houses were found positive with Aedes species out of 1813 houses 
      surveyed. It was further observed that the probability of presence of positive 
      premises was four times higher in the premises with 75% shadow compared with 
      premises with a 25% shadow. These findings showed a significant association (p < 
      0.001) with positive premises.

TI  - Spatial and temporal patterns of abundance of Aedes aegypti L. (Stegomyia aegypti) 
      and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) [Stegomyia albopictus (Skuse)] in southern Florida.
PG  - 421-9
LID - 10.1111/mve.12000 [doi]
AB  - Invasion by mosquito vectors of disease may impact the distribution of resident 
      mosquitoes, resulting in novel patterns of vectors and concomitant risk for disease. 
      One example of such an impact is the invasion by Aedes albopictus (Skuse) [Stegomyia 
      albopictus (Skuse)] (Diptera: Culicidae) of North America and this species' 
      interaction with Aedes aegypti L. (Stegomyia aegypti L). We hypothesized that Ae. 
      aegypti would be found in urban, coastal areas that experience hotter and drier 
      conditions, whereas Ae. albopictus would be more commonly found in suburban and 
      rural areas that are cooler and wetter. In addition, we hypothesized that Ae. 
      aegypti would be more abundant early in the wet season, whereas Ae. albopictus would 
      be more abundant later in the wet season. Urban areas were drier, hotter and 
      contained more Ae. aegypti than suburban or rural areas. Aedes aegypti was 
      relatively more abundant early in the wet season, whereas Ae. albopictus was more 
      abundant in both the late wet season and the dry season. The spatial patterns of 
      inter- and intraspecific encounters between these species were also described. The 
      distribution of these mosquitoes is correlated with abiotic conditions, and with 
      temperature, humidity and the relative availability of rain-filled containers. 
      Understanding the ecological determinants of species distribution can provide 
      insight into the biology of these vectors and important information for their 
      appropriate control.

TI  - LoFreq: a sequence-quality aware, ultra-sensitive variant caller for uncovering 
      cell-population heterogeneity from high-throughput sequencing datasets.
PG  - 11189-201
LID - 10.1093/nar/gks918 [doi]
AB  - The study of cell-population heterogeneity in a range of biological systems, from 
      viruses to bacterial isolates to tumor samples, has been transformed by recent 
      advances in sequencing throughput. While the high-coverage afforded can be used, in 
      principle, to identify very rare variants in a population, existing ad hoc 
      approaches frequently fail to distinguish true variants from sequencing errors. We 
      report a method (LoFreq) that models sequencing run-specific error rates to 
      accurately call variants occurring in <0.05% of a population. Using simulated and 
      real datasets (viral, bacterial and human), we show that LoFreq has near-perfect 
      specificity, with significantly improved sensitivity compared with existing methods 
      and can efficiently analyze deep Illumina sequencing datasets without resorting to 
      approximations or heuristics. We also present experimental validation for LoFreq on 
      two different platforms (Fluidigm and Sequenom) and its application to call rare 
      somatic variants from exome sequencing datasets for gastric cancer. Source code and 
      executables for LoFreq are freely available at 
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/lofreq/.

TI  - Vaccinia and other viruses with available vaccines show marked homology with the 
      HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein: the prospect of using existing vaccines to stem the 
      AIDS pandemic.
PG  - 222-31
LID - 10.3109/08923973.2011.596542 [doi]
AB  - Cross-reactive immunity occurs when infection with or vaccination against one virus 
      protects against another related family member. A search for homologues of the HIV-1 
      envelope glycoprotein revealed that it is composed of thousands of intercalating and 
      overlapping viral matches of pentapeptide or longer gapped consensi, belonging to 
      over 70% of the currently sequenced virome, infecting all kingdoms from bacteria to 
      man. It was also highly homologous to proteins from the Visna/Maedi and other ovine 
      viruses, while other proteins (nef/tat/gag/pol) were homologous to proteins from the 
      equine infectious anaemia virus and HTLV-2/HTLV-3 viruses. This phenomenon suggests 
      that horizontal gene transfer from coinfecting RNA and DNA viruses to retroviruses 
      is extensive, providing a route for the subsequent insertion of non-retroviral genes 
      into human and other genomes via retroviral integration. This homology includes all 
      viruses for which vaccines already exist. Cross-reactive immunity may be operative 
      in AIDS, as Vaccinia vaccination decreases viral replication in HIV-1 infected 
      patients' cells, for the CCR5 tropic form. Measles, Dengue virus, or GB virus C 
      infections also decrease the HIV-1 viral load. A resumption of Vaccinia/smallpox 
      vaccination might be expected to have a significant effect on the AIDS pandemic, and 
      a careful study of the potential uses of other existing viral and bacterial vaccines 
      merits close attention. This phenomenon may also be relevant to other recalcitrant 
      viruses, bacteria, and parasites for which no vaccine exists and the armory of 
      existing vaccines may have a role to play in diseases other than those for which 
      they were designed.

TI  - Insecticidal activity against Aedes aegypti of m-pentadecadienyl-phenol isolated 
      from Myracrodruon urundeuva seeds.
PG  - 1380-4
LID - 10.1002/ps.3316 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myracrodruon urundeuva Fr. Allemao is a common tree in the Caatinga that 
      has been widely used for various medical purposes. Previous studies showed that the 
      ethanol seed extract of M. urundeuva has potent activity against the larval stage of 
      the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. Given this potential insecticidal activity, 
      bioguided separation steps were performed in order to isolate the active 
      compound(s). RESULTS: The isolation process resulted in only one active chemical 
      compound, identified by infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry as 
      m-pentadecadienyl-phenol. This compound presented potent larvicidal and pupicidal 
      activity (LC50 10.16 and 99.06 µg mL(-1) respectively) and great egg hatching 
      inhibitory activity (IC50 49.79 µg mL(-1)). The mode of action was investigated 
      through observations of behavioural and morphological changes performed in 
      third-instar larvae treated with m-pentadecadienyl-phenol solution after 1, 6, 12, 
      16 and 20 h of exposure. Some changes were observed as flooding of the tracheal 
      system, alterations in siphonal valves and anal gills and lethargy, probably caused 
      by the strong anticholinesterasic activity reported previously. CONCLUSION: The 
      compound isolated from M. urundeuva seeds, m-pentadecadienyl-phenol, showed potent 
      activity against immature stages of dengue vector, Ae. aegypti, being considered the 
      main larvicidal principle.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyrethroids are increasingly used to block the transmission of diseases 
      spread by Aedes aegypti such as dengue and yellow fever. However, insecticide 
      resistance poses a serious threat, thus there is an urgent need to identify the 
      genes and proteins associated with pyrethroid resistance in order to produce 
      effective counter measures. In Ae. aegypti, overexpression of P450s such as the 
      CYP9J32 gene have been linked with pyrethroid resistance. Our aim was to confirm the 
      role of CYP9J32 and other P450s in insecticide metabolism in order to identify 
      potential diagnostic resistance markers. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have 
      expressed CYP9J32 in Escherichia coli and show that the enzyme can metabolize the 
      pyrethroids permethrin and deltamethrin. In addition, three other Ae. aegypti P450s 
      (CYP9J24, CYP9J26, CYP9J28) were found capable of pyrethroid metabolism, albeit with 
      lower activity. Both Ae. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae P450s (CYP's 6M2, 6Z2, 6P3) 
      were screened against fluorogenic and luminescent substrates to identify potential 
      diagnostic probes for P450 activity. Luciferin-PPXE was preferentially metabolised 
      by the three major pyrethroid metabolisers (CYP9J32, CYP6M2 and CYP6P3), identifying 
      a potential diagnostic substrate for these P450s. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: P450s 
      have been identified with the potential to confer pyrethroid resistance in 
      Ae.aegypti. It is recommended that over expression of these enzymes should be 
      monitored as indicators of resistance where pyrethroids are used.

TI  - Espirito Santo virus: a new birnavirus that replicates in insect cells.
PG  - 2390-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.06614-11 [doi]
AB  - Espirito Santo virus (ESV) is a newly discovered virus recovered as contamination in 
      a sample of a virulent strain of dengue-2 virus (strain 44/2), which was recovered 
      from a patient in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil, and amplified in insect 
      cells. ESV was found to be dependent upon coinfection with a virulent strain of 
      dengue-2 virus and to replicate in C6/36 insect cells but not in mammalian Vero 
      cells. A sequence of the genome has been produced by de novo assembly and was not 
      found to match to any known viral sequence. An incomplete match to the nucleotide 
      sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Drosophila X virus (DXV), another 
      birnavirus, could be detected. Mass spectrometry analysis of ESV proteins found no 
      matches in the protein data banks. However, peptides recovered by mass spectrometry 
      corresponded to the de novo-assembled sequence by BLAST analysis. The composition 
      and three-dimensional structure of ESV are presented, and its sequence is compared 
      to those of other members of the birnavirus family. Although the virus was found to 
      belong to the family Birnaviridae, biochemical and sequence information for ESV 
      differed from that of DXV, the representative species of the genus Entomobirnavirus. 
      Thus, significant differences underscore the uniqueness of this infectious agent, 
      and its relationship to the coinfecting virus is discussed.

LID - 10.1007/s00436-011-2702-z [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a herbal formulation to control dengue 
      vector mosquitoes. PONNEEM, a novel herbal formulation prepared using the oils of 
      neem (Azadirachta indica), karanj (Pongamia glabra) and their extracts, was tested 
      for larvicidal, ovicidal and oviposition deterrent activities against Aedes aegypti 
      and Aedes albopictus at 1, 0.5, 0.3 and 0.1 ppm concentrations. Cent percent 
      larvicidal and ovicidal activities were observed at 0.1 ppm in the two mosquito 
      species under laboratory and sunlight-exposed conditions up to 12 months from the 
      date of manufacture. Oviposition deterrent activity of 69.97% and 71.05% was 
      observed at 1 ppm concentration of PONNEEM against A. aegypti and A. albopictus, 
      respectively. Reduction in enzyme levels for α-esterase was 0.089 ± 0.008 and 0.099 
      ± 0.140 μg napthol produced/min/mg larval protein; for β-esterase, it was 0.004 ± 
      0.009 and 0.001 ± 0.028 μg napthol produced/min/mg larval protein; for glutathione 
      S-transferase, it was 10.4814 ± 0.23 and 11.4811 ± 0.21 μmol/min/mg larval protein 
      and for total protein, it was 0.177 ± 0.010 and 0.008 ± 0.005 mg/individual larva in 
      treated groups of A. aegypti and A. albopictus, respectively. The nontarget 
      organisms such as Gambusia affinis and Diplonychus indicus were not affected. No 
      mortality was observed in control. PONNEEM can be used effectively for the 
      management of human vector mosquitoes.

TI  - Integrating health promotion and disease prevention interventions with vaccination 
      in Honduras.
PG  - S77-81
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jir774 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to review and describe health interventions integrated with 
      immunization delivery, both routine and during national vaccination weeks, in 
      Honduras between 1991 and 2009. METHODS: We compiled and examined all annual 
      evaluation reports from the national Expanded Program on Immunization and reports 
      from the national vaccination weeks (NVWs) between 1988 and 2009. We held 
      discussions with the persons responsible for immunization and other programs in the 
      Health Secretary of Honduras for the same time period. RESULTS: Since 1991, several 
      health promotion and disease prevention interventions have been integrated with 
      immunization delivery, including vitamin A supplementation (since 1994), folic acid 
      supplementation (2003), early detection of retinoblastoma (since 2003), 
      breastfeeding promotion (2007-2008), and disease control activities during public 
      health emergencies, such as cholera control (1991-1992) and dengue control 
      activities (since 1991, when a dengue emergency coincides with the NVW). Success 
      factors included sufficient funds and supplies to ensure sustainability and joint 
      planning, delivery, and monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Several health interventions have 
      been integrated with vaccination delivery in Honduras for nearly 20 years. The 
      immunization program in Honduras has sufficient structure, organization, acceptance, 
      coverage, and experience to achieve successful integration with health interventions 
      if carefully planned and suitably implemented.

TI  - [K-othrine WG250 (deltamethrine)-based treatment in an area characterized by high 
      infestation rates of Aedes aegypti].
PG  - 330-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: dengue and its lethal form, that is, dengue hemorrhagic fever, has 
      significantly increased in Las Americas, being the Aedes aegypti the main and the 
      only transmitting vector till now. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the effectiveness of 
      K-Othrine WG250 (deltamethrin) in residual (perifocal) applications in rest sites 
      and in breeding sites of Aedes aegypti. METHODS: from February to June 2011, a 
      perifocal residual treatment was applied in San Juan de Dios people's council of 
      "José Martí" university polyclinic in Camaguey. It was directed to rest and breeding 
      sites of the vector, for which several areas comprising different number of 
      non-adjacent and randomly chosen houses, with high and similar rates of infestation 
      in the period before the treatment, were selected. The application of this treatment 
      was based on the use of IKA-9 hand sprayers at a dose of 1 g/l of water, with fitted 
      conical nozzle for three areas and with flat nozzles 80-02 in the other three areas 
      to deposit 25 mg ia/m2. Focality was monitored 5 months before the applications and 
      3 months afterwards by means of entomological surveys conducted in the selected 
      universe of houses. RESULTS: the number of foci was reduced to 0 in the first month 
      after the application if compared to the existing number before the treatment and 
      with both types of nozzles. Fifteen positive reservoirs were reported in June, 
      mainly low water tanks located outside the house. CONCLUSIONS: this product showed 
      high effectiveness for 3 months in the Aedes aegypti control as part of the residual 
      (perifocal) treatment. Therefore, it should be considered as an alternative in the 
      surveillance and control strategies aimed at this vector.

TI  - Battling malaria iceberg incorporating strategic reforms in achieving Millennium 
      Development Goals & malaria elimination in India.
PG  - 907-25
AB  - Malaria control in India has occupied high priority in health sector consuming major 
      resources of the Central and State governments. Several new initiatives were 
      launched from time to time supported by foreign aids but malaria situation has 
      remained static and worsened in years of good rainfall. At times malaria relented 
      temporarily but returned with vengeance at the local, regional and national level, 
      becoming more resilient by acquiring resistance in the vectors and the parasites. 
      National developments to improve the economy, without health impact assessment, have 
      had adverse consequences by providing enormous breeding grounds for the vectors that 
      have become refractory to interventions. As a result, malaria prospers and its 
      control is in dilemma, as finding additional resources is becoming difficult with 
      the ongoing financial crisis. Endemic countries must contribute to make up the 
      needed resources, if malaria is to be contained. Malaria control requires long term 
      planning, one that will reduce receptivity and vulnerability, and uninterrupted 
      financial support for sustained interventions. While this seems to be a far cry, the 
      environment is becoming more receptive for vectors, and epidemics visit the country 
      diverting major resources in their containment, e.g. malaria, dengue and dengue 
      haemorrhagic fevers, and Chikungunya virus infection. In the last six decades 
      malaria has taken deep roots and diversified into various ecotypes, the control of 
      these ecotypes requires local knowledge about the vectors and the parasites. In this 
      review we outline the historical account of malaria and methods of control that have 
      lifted the national economy in many countries. While battles against malaria should 
      continue at the local level, there is a need for large scale environmental 
      improvement. Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has provided huge funds 
      for malaria control worldwide touching US$ 2 billion in 2011. Unfortunately it is 
      likely to decline to US$ 1.5 billion in the coming years against the annual 
      requirement of US$ 5 billion. While appreciating the foreign assistance, we wish to 
      highlight the fact that unless we have internal strength of resources and manpower, 
      sustained battles against malaria may face serious problems in achieving the final 
      goal of malaria elimination.

TI  - Homograft banking in Singapore: two years of cardiovascular tissue banking in 
      Southeast Asia.
PG  - 187-94
LID - 10.1007/s10561-012-9310-8 [doi]
AB  - Established in 2008, the National Cardiovascular Homograft Bank (NCHB) has been 
      instrumental in creating an available supply of cardiovascular tissues for 
      implantation in Singapore. This article introduces its collaboration with Singapore 
      General Hospital Skin Bank Unit. The procedure of homograft recovery, processing, 
      cryopreservation and quality assurance are presented. Since its establishment, the 
      NCHB has followed the guidelines set by the Ministry of Health Singapore and the 
      American Association of Tissue Banks. A total of 57 homografts had been recovered 
      and 40 homografts were determined to be suitable for clinical use. The most 
      significant reasons for non-clinical use are positive microbiological culture or 
      unsuitable graft condition. Crucial findings prompted reviews and implementation of 
      new procedures to improve the safety of homograft recipients. These include (1) a 
      change in antibiotic decontamination regime from penicillin and streptomycin to 
      amikacin and vancomycin after a review and (2) mandating histopathogical examination 
      since the discovery of cardiac sarcoidosis in a previously undiagnosed donor. 
      Further, the NCHB also routinely performs dengue virus screening, for donors 
      suspected of dengue infection. Cultural factors which affect the donation rate are 
      also briefly explored. By 2010, 31 homografts had been implanted into recipients 
      with congenital or acquired heart valve conditions. More than half of these 
      recipients were children. Post-operative outcomes had been encouraging, with no 
      report of adverse events attributed to implanted homografts.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dengue is a serious public health problem worldwide, with cases 
      reported annually in tropical and subtropical regions. Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 
      1762), the main vector of dengue, is a domiciliary species with high dispersal and 
      survival capacities and can use various artificial containers as breeding sites. We 
      assessed potential container breeding sites of A. aegypti in the municipality of 
      Caxias, Maranhão, Brazil. METHODS: In the initial phase, we analyzed 900 properties 
      in 3 neighborhoods during the dry and rainy seasons (August-October 2005 and 
      February-April 2006, respectively). During the second sampling period, September 
      2006-August 2007, we used 5 assessment cycles for 300 properties in a single 
      neighborhood. RESULTS: During the dry and rainy seasons, water-storage containers 
      comprised 55.7% (n = 1,970) and 48.5% (n = 1,836) of the total containers inspected, 
      and showed the highest productivity of immature A. aegypti; we found 23.7 and 106.1 
      individuals/container, respectively, in peridomicile sites. In intradomicile sites, 
      water-storage containers were also the most important breeding sites with 86.4% (n = 
      973) and 85.6% (n = 900) of all containers and a mean of 7.9 and 108.3 
      individuals/container in the dry and rainy seaso-October 2006 (1,342). The highest 
      number of positives (70) was recorded in May, mostly (94%) in storage containers. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Storage containers are the principal and most productive A. aegypti 
      breeding sites and are a major contributing factor to the maintenance of this vector 
      in Caxias.

AB  - Over the last two decades, morbidity and mortality from malaria and dengue fever 
      among other pathogens are an increasing Public Health problem. The increase in the 
      geographic distribution of vectors is accompanied by the emergence of viruses and 
      diseases in new areas. There are insufficient specific therapeutic drugs available 
      and there are no reliable vaccines for malaria or dengue, although some progress has 
      been achieved, there is still a long way between its development and actual field 
      use. Most mosquito control measures have failed to achieve their goals, mostly 
      because of the mosquito's great reproductive capacity and genomic flexibility. 
      Chemical control is increasingly restricted due to potential human toxicity, 
      mortality in no target organisms, insecticide resistance, and other environmental 
      impacts. Other strategies for mosquito control are desperately needed. The Sterile 
      Insect Technique (SIT) is a species-specific and environmentally benign method for 
      insect population suppression, it is based on mass rearing, radiation mediated 
      sterilization, and release of a large number of male insects. Releasing of Insects 
      carrying a dominant lethal gene (RIDL) offers a solution to many of the drawbacks of 
      traditional SIT that have limited its application in mosquitoes while maintaining 
      its environmentally friendly and species-specific utility. The self-limiting nature 
      of sterile mosquitoes tends to make the issues related to field use of these 
      somewhat less challenging than for self-spreading systems characteristic of 
      population replacement strategies. They also are closer to field use, so might be 
      appropriate to consider first. The prospect of genetic control methods against 
      mosquito vectored human diseases is rapidly becoming a reality, many decisions will 
      need to be made on a national, regional and international level regarding the 
      biosafety, social, cultural and ethical aspects of the use and deployment of these 
      vector control methods.

      infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

LID - e43953
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is one of the leading causes of childhood mortality, yet 
      controversy surrounds the current treatment approach. We conducted a systematic 
      review to assess the evidence base for fluid resuscitation in the treatment of 
      children with shock due to sepsis or severe infection. METHODS: We searched 3 
      databases for randomized trials, quasi-randomized trials, and controlled 
      before-after studies assessing children with septic shock in which at least one 
      group was treated with bolus fluids. The primary outcome was mortality at 48 hours. 
      Assessment of methodological quality followed the GRADE criteria. Relative risks 
      (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and data pooled using 
      fixed-effects method. RESULTS: 13 studies met our inclusion criteria. No bolus has 
      significantly better mortality outcomes at 48 hours for children with general septic 
      shock (RR 0.69; 95%CI 0.54-0.89), and children with malaria (RR 0.64; 95%CI 
      0.45-0.91) when compared to giving any bolus. This result is largely driven by a 
      single, high quality trial (the FEAST trial). There is no evidence investigating 
      bolus vs no bolus in children with Dengue fever or severe malnutrition. Colloid and 
      crystalloid boluses were found to have similar effects on mortality across all 
      sub-groups (general septic shock, malaria, Dengue fever, and severe malnutrition). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The majority of all randomized evidence to date comes from the FEAST 
      trial, which found that fluid boluses were harmful compared to no bolus. Simple 
      algorithms are needed to support health-care providers in the triage of patients to 
      determine who could potentially be harmed by the provision of bolus fluids, and who 
      will benefit.

TI  - Vertebrate hosts of Aedes aegypti and Aedes mediovittatus (Diptera: Culicidae) in 
      rural Puerto Rico.
PG  - 917-21
AB  - The distribution of Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.), the main vector of dengue 
      viruses (DENV) worldwide, overlaps with Aedes (Gymnometopa) mediovittatus 
      (Coquillett), the Caribbean treehole mosquito, in urban, suburban, and rural areas. 
      Ae. mediovittatus is a competent vector of DENV with high rates of vertical DENV 
      transmission in the laboratory. This study determined whether Ae. mediovittatus 
      feeds on humans and compared its feeding patterns with co-occurring Ae. aegypti in 
      two rural communities of Puerto Rico. Adult mosquitoes were captured for three 
      consecutive days every week from July 2009 to May 2010 using BG-Sentinel traps with 
      skin lures that were placed in the front yard of houses in both communities. Three 
      methods were used to identify the 756 bloodmeals obtained in this study: a multiplex 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for humans and dogs targeting cytochrome b; a PCR 
      targeting the 16S rRNA; and a nested PCR targeting cytochrome b. Ae. mediovittatus 
      fed mostly on humans (45-52%) and dogs (28-32%) but also on cats, cows, horses, 
      rats, pigs, goats, sheep, and chickens. Ae. aegypti fed mostly on humans (76-79%) 
      and dogs (18-21%) but also on cats, horses, and chickens. Our results indicate that 
      Ae. mediovittatus may have a relatively high rate of vector-human contact, which 
      might facilitate virus transmission or harborage in rural areas of Puerto Rico.

TI  - Gene amplification, ABC transporters and cytochrome P450s: unraveling the molecular

PG  - e1692
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001692 [doi]
LID - e1692
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyrethroid insecticides are widely utilized in dengue control. However, 
      the major vector, Aedes aegypti, is becoming increasingly resistant to these 
      insecticides and this is impacting on the efficacy of control measures. The near 
      complete transcriptome of two pyrethroid resistant populations from the Caribbean 
      was examined to explore the molecular basis of this resistance. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 
      Two previously described target site mutations, 1016I and 1534C were detected in 
      pyrethroid resistant populations from Grand Cayman and Cuba. In addition between two 
      and five per cent of the Ae. aegypti transcriptome was differentially expressed in 
      the resistant populations compared to a laboratory susceptible population. 
      Approximately 20 per cent of the genes over-expressed in resistant mosquitoes were 
      up-regulated in both Caribbean populations (107 genes). Genes with putative 
      monooxygenase activity were significantly over represented in the up-regulated 
      subset, including five CYP9 P450 genes. Quantitative PCR was used to confirm the 
      higher transcript levels of multiple cytochrome P450 genes from the CYP9J family and 
      an ATP binding cassette transporter. Over expression of two genes, CYP9J26 and 
      ABCB4, is due, at least in part, to gene amplification. SIGNIFICANCE: These results, 
      and those from other studies, strongly suggest that increases in the amount of the 
      CYP9J cytochrome P450s are an important mechanism of pyrethroid resistance in Ae. 
      aegypti. The genetic redundancy resulting from the expansion of this gene family 
      makes it unlikely that a single gene or mutation responsible for pyrethroid 
      resistance will be identified in this mosquito species. However, the results from 
      this study do pave the way for the development of new pyrethroid synergists and 
      improved resistance diagnostics. The role of copy number polymorphisms in 
      detoxification and transporter genes in providing protection against insecticide 
      exposure requires further investigation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence, etiology, short term outcome and predictors 
      of mortality in hospitalized children aged 1 mo to 13 y with Acute Kidney Injury 
      (AKI). METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in the pediatric 
      wards and the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary hospital in 
      southern India, to study the clinico-etiological profile of AKI (defined according 
      to the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria). From June 2010 through March 2011, 
      2376 children were included in the study. RESULTS: The incidence of AKI was 5.2 % in 
      the pediatric wards and 25.1 % in the PICU. AKI occurred in association with 
      infections (55.4 %), acute glomerulonephritis (16.9 %), cardiac disease (4.8 %), 
      envenomations (4.2 %) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (3.6 %). Pneumonia constituted 
      26.1 % of the infections. Tropical febrile illnesses (dengue, scrub typhus, enteric 
      fever, cholera, tuberculosis, malaria and leptospirosis) constituted 15.6 % of 
      children with AKI. Dialysis was required in 14.5 % of patients; mortality was 17.5 
      %. A significant proportion of children (17.5 % of survivors) had partial renal 
      recovery at discharge. On multivariate logistic regression, dysnatremia and 
      meningoencephalitis were independent predictors of mortality in AKI. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The incidence of AKI is high in the patient population, including the non-critically 
      ill children. AKI continues to be associated with adverse outcomes. Presence of 
      dysnatremia and meningoencephalitis are poor predictors of outcome in AKI.

AB  - The adverse effects of chemical insecticides-based intervention measures for the 
      control of mosquito vectors have received wide public apprehension because of 
      several problems like insecticide resistance, resurgence of pest species, 
      environmental pollution, toxic hazards to humans, and non-target organisms. These 
      problems have necessitated the need to explore and develop alternative strategies 
      using eco-friendly, environmentally safe, bio-degradable plant products which are 
      non-toxic to non-target organisms too. In view of this, 15 plant species were 
      collected from local areas in New Delhi, India. Different parts of these plants were 
      separated, dried, mechanically grinded, and sieved to get fine powder. The 200 g of 
      each part was soaked in 1000 mL of different solvents separately and the crude 
      extracts, thus formed, were concentrated using a vacuum evaporator at 45°C under low 
      pressure. Each extract was screened to explore its potential as a mosquito 
      larvicidal agent against early fourth instars of dengue vector, Aedes aegypti using 
      WHO protocol. The preliminary screening showed that only 10 plants possessed 
      larvicidal potential as they could result in 100% mortality at 1000 ppm. Further 
      evaluation of the potential larvicidal extracts established the hexane leaf extract 
      of Lantana camara to be most effective extract exhibiting a significant LC(50) value 
      of 30.71 ppm while the Phyllanthus emblica fruit extract was found to be least 
      effective with an LC(50) value of 298.93 ppm. The extracts made from different parts 
      of other five plants; Achyranthes aspera, Zingiber officinalis, Ricinus communis, 
      Trachyspermum ammi, and Cassia occidentalis also possessed significant larvicidal 
      potential with LC(50) values ranging from 55.0 to 74.67 ppm. Other three extracts 
      showed moderate toxicity against A. aegypti larvae. Further investigations would be 
      needed to isolate and identify the primary component responsible for the larvicidal 
      efficiency of the effective plants.

AB  - We conducted a prospective, inpatient fever study in malaria-endemic Papua, 
      Indonesia to determine non-malaria fever etiologies. Investigations included malaria 
      blood films, blood culture, paired serologic samples analysis for dengue, Japanese 
      encephalitis, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, murine typhus, and spotted fever group 
      rickettsia. During 1997-2000, 226 patients (127 males and 99 females) 1-80 years of 
      age (median age = 25 years) were enrolled. Positive blood cultures (n = 34, 15%) 
      were obtained for Salmonella Typhi (n = 13), Escherichia coli (n = 8), Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae (n = 6), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 1), 
      and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1). Twenty (8.8%) patients were positive for 
      leptospirosis by polymerase chain reaction. Eighty (35.4%) of 226 patients had ≥ 1 
      positive serology, diagnostic for 15 rickettsial and 9 dengue cases. Acid-fast 
      bacilli-positive sputum was obtained from three patients. Most common confirmed (81 
      of 226, 35.8%)/suspected diagnoses were typhoid fever (n = 41), pneumonia (n = 29), 
      leptospirosis (n = 28), urinary tract infections (n = 20), rickettsioses (n = 19), 
      dengue (n = 17), and meningitis/encephalitis (n = 15). There were 17 deaths, 7 
      (46.7%) were caused by meningitis/encephalitis. Multiple positive serologic results 
      and few confirmed diagnoses indicate the need for improved diagnostics.

TI  - Species diversity of mosquito breeding in rubber plantations of Kerala, India.
PG  - 114-5
AB  - During south-west monsoon season, rubber plantations in Kerala have been found to 
      provide ideal conditions for the proliferation of mosquitoes. In a study conducted 
      from June 2005 to September 2010 in Kannur, Wayanad, and Kozhikode districts, 12 
      species of mosquitoes in 6 genera--Aedes, Armigeres, Culex, Heizmannia, 
      Toxorhynchites, and Verrallina--were found to breed in rain water-filled cups used 
      for collecting rubber latex. The only vector species found was Aedes albopictus, 
      known for its ability to transmit dengue and chikungunya. The combinations of 
      species found associated in the latex cups is also presented.

LID - e1892
AB  - Incidence of disease due to dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV) and yellow fever 
      (YFV) viruses is increasing in many parts of the world. The viruses are primarily 
      transmitted by Aedes aegypti, a highly domesticated mosquito species that is 
      notoriously difficult to control. When transinfected into Ae. aegypti, the 
      intracellular bacterium Wolbachia has recently been shown to inhibit replication of 
      DENVs, CHIKV, malaria parasites and filarial nematodes, providing a potentially 
      powerful biocontrol strategy for human pathogens. Because the extent of pathogen 
      reduction can be influenced by the strain of bacterium, we examined whether the wMel 
      strain of Wolbachia influenced CHIKV and YFV infection in Ae. aegypti. Following 
      exposure to viremic blood meals, CHIKV infection and dissemination rates were 
      significantly reduced in mosquitoes with the wMel strain of Wolbachia compared to 
      Wolbachia-uninfected controls. However, similar rates of infection and dissemination 
      were observed in wMel infected and non-infected Ae. aegypti when intrathoracic 
      inoculation was used to deliver virus. YFV infection, dissemination and replication 
      were similar in wMel-infected and control mosquitoes following intrathoracic 
      inoculations. In contrast, mosquitoes with the wMelPop strain of Wolbachia showed at 
      least a 10(4) times reduction in YFV RNA copies compared to controls. The extent of 
      reduction in virus infection depended on Wolbachia strain, titer and strain of the 
      virus, and mode of exposure. Although originally proposed for dengue biocontrol, our 
      results indicate a Wolbachia-based strategy also holds considerable promise for YFV 
      and CHIKV suppression.

TI  - Sphingosine kinase 1 in viral infections.
PG  - 73-84
LID - 10.1002/rmv.1718 [doi]
AB  - Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) is an enzyme that phosphorylates the lipid sphingosine 
      to generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P can act intracellularly as a 
      signaling molecule and extracellularly as a receptor ligand. The SphK1/S1P axis has 
      well-described roles in cell signaling, the cell death/survival decision, the 
      production of a pro-inflammatory response, immunomodulation, and control of vascular 
      integrity. Agents targeting the SphK1/S1P axis are being actively developed as 
      therapeutics for cancer and immunological and inflammatory disorders. Control of 
      cell death/survival and pro-inflammatory immune responses is central to the 
      pathology of infectious disease, and we can capitalize on the knowledge provided by 
      investigations of SphK1/S1P in cancer and immunology to assess its application to 
      selected human infections. We have herein reviewed the growing literature relating 
      viral infections to changes in SphK1 and S1P. SphK1 activity is reportedly increased 
      following human cytomegalovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infections, and 
      elevated SphK1 enhances influenza virus infection. In contrast, SphK1 activity is 
      reduced in bovine viral diarrhea virus and dengue virus infections. Sphingosine 
      analogs that modulate S1P receptors have proven useful in animal models in 
      alleviating influenza virus infection but have shown no benefit in simian human 
      immunodeficiency virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections. We have 
      rationalized a role for SphK1/S1P in dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and Ross River 
      virus infections, on the basis of the biology and the pathology of these diseases. 
      The increasing number of effective SphK1 and S1P modulating agents currently in 
      development makes it timely to investigate these roles with the potential for 
      developing modulators of SphK1 and S1P for novel anti-viral therapies.

TI  - Evaluation of Adamantane Derivatives as Inhibitors of Dengue Virus mRNA Cap 
      Methyltransferase by Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulations.

AB  - Binding of the Dengue virus S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent mRNA cap 
      methyltransferase (NS5MTaseDV ) with adamantane derivatives was explored using 
      molecular modeling methods and (nucleoside-2'O)-methyltransferase bioassay. The 
      studied compounds include urea derivatives of adamantane and the antiviral drugs 
      amantadine and rimantadine. The urea derivatives of adamantanes had previously been 
      identified as inhibitors of NS5MTaseDV . The docking simulations using GOLD, Glide, 
      and Dock give consistent binding modes and binding affinities of adamantanes in the 
      AdoMet-binding site of NS5MTaseDV and, in particular, yield similar positions for 
      the previously found inhibitors. Combined, they perfectly correspond to the bioassay 
      measurements of nucleoside-2'O-methyltransferase activity of NS5TaseDV , which 
      confirmed inhibitory properties of the active urea adamantane but did not show 
      inhibitory activity for amantadine and rimantadine. We also employed microscopic 
      molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a linear interaction energy (LIE) method to 
      verify the docking results. The MD/LIE binding free energies of selected 
      protein-inhibitor complexes agree overall with the binding affinities from docking 
      and demonstrate that amantadine and rimantadine only weakly bind at the explored 
      site. The MD simulations also demonstrated the flexible character of a protein loop 
      that is located between the β2 and β3 strands and is part of the AdoMet-binding 
      pocket of NS5MTaseDV .

PG  - e1792

LID - e1792
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a little known flavivirus that caused a major 
      outbreak in 2007, in the South-western Pacific Island of Yap. It causes dengue-like 
      syndromes but with milder symptoms. In Africa, where it was first isolated, ZIKV is 
      mainly transmitted by sylvatic Aedes mosquitoes. The virus has also been isolated 
      from Ae. aegypti and it is considered to be the vector involved in the urban 
      transmission of the virus. Transmission of the virus by an African strain of Ae. 
      aegypti has also been demonstrated under laboratory conditions. The aim of the 
      present study is to describe the oral susceptibility of a Singapore strain of Ae. 
      aegypti to ZIKV, under conditions that simulate local climate. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: To assess the receptivity of Singapore's Ae. aegypti to the virus, we 
      orally exposed a local mosquito strain to a Ugandan strain of ZIKV. Upon exposure, 
      fully engorged mosquitoes were maintained in an environmental chamber set at 29 °C 
      and 70-75% RH. Eight mosquitoes were then sampled daily from day 1 to day 7, and 
      subsequently on days 10 and 14 post exposure (pe). The virus titer of the midgut and 
      salivary glands of each mosquito were determined using a tissue culture infectious 
      dose(50) (TCID(50)) assay. High midgut infection and salivary gland dissemination 
      rates were observed. By day 5 after the infectious blood meal, ZIKV was found in the 
      salivary glands of more than half of the mosquitoes tested (62%); and by day 10, all 
      mosquitoes were potentially infective. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study showed 
      that Singapore's urban Ae. aegypti are susceptible and are potentially capable of 
      transmitting ZIKV. The virus could be established in Singapore should it be 
      introduced. Nevertheless, Singapore's current dengue control strategy is applicable 
      to control ZIKV.

TI  - Deciphering arboviral emergence within insular ecosystems.
PG  - 1333-9
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2012.03.024 [doi]
AB  - The spatial dynamics of zoonotic arthropod-borne viruses is a fashionable though 
      challenging topic. Inter-human local transmission of a given arbovirus during an 
      outbreak and its spread over large distances are considered as key parameters of 
      emergence. Here, we suggest that insular ecosystems provide ideal natural 
      "laboratory" conditions to uncouple local transmission from long distance spread, 
      and differentiate these two processes. Due to geographic isolation, often-limited 
      land surface area and relatively homogenous ecosystems, oceanic islands display low 
      species richness and often-high levels of endemism. These aspects provide the means 
      for comprehensive entomological surveys and investigations of original host/pathogen 
      interactions. In addition, islands are interconnected through discrete anthropogenic 
      and non-anthropogenic exchanges: whilst islands maintain a substantial level of 
      human and domestic animal exchange with other neighbouring or distant territories, 
      they also comprise dispersal and migratory pathways of volant organisms (insects, 
      birds and bats). Hence, both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic exchanges in island 
      systems are easier to identify and investigate than in continuous, continental 
      systems. Finally, island ecosystems tend to be notably simpler, more prone to 
      invasive taxa and, therefore, easier to document the colonization or displacement of 
      vector species. These different aspects are presented and overlaid upon the spread 
      of arboviruses within two distinct insular systems: islands of Polynesia and the 
      south-western Indian Ocean. The former have been repeatedly affected by Dengue fever 
      epidemics, while the latter recently suffered four successive epidemics, probably of 
      east African origin, three of which involved the emerging viruses Chikungunya, Rift 
      Valley and Dengue fever. Here, we review some new insights into arboviral spread and 
      evolution associated with investigations that followed these epidemics, as well as 
      several aspects that make insular ecosystems favourable to the investigation of 
      arboviral transmission and spread.

TI  - Larvicidal efficacy of Adhatoda vasica (L.) Nees against the bancroftian filariasis

AB  - The larvicidal activities of methanolic fractions from Adhatoda vasica leaf extracts 
      were investigated against the bancroftian filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus 
      and dengue vector Aedes aegypti. The results indicated that the mortality rates was 
      high at 100, 150, 200 and 250 ppm of methanol extract of fractions III with R (f) 
      value 0.67 and methanol extract of fraction V with R (f) value 0.64 of A. vasica 
      against all the larval instars of C. quinquefasciatus and A. aegypti. The result of 
      log probit analysis (at 95% confidence level) revealed that lethal concentration, 
      LC(50) and LC(90) values were 106.13 and 180.6 ppm for fraction III, 110.6 and 170 
      ppm for fraction V of C. quinquefasciatus. And, the LC(50) and LC(90) values were 
      157.5 and 215.5 ppm for fraction III of A. aegypti and 120 and 243.5 ppm for the 
      fraction V of A. aegypti, respectively. All the tested fractions proved to have 
      strong larvicidal activity (doses from 100 to 250 ppm) against C. quinquefasciatus 
      and A. aegypti. In general, second instar was more susceptible than the later 
      instar. The results achieved suggest that, in addition to their ethnopharmacology 
      value, A. vasica may also serve as a natural larvicidal agent.

AB  - Diagnostic efforts are usually centered on malaria in febrile travelers returning 
      from the tropics. However, by focusing on malaria other important diagnostic 
      considerations are easily overlooked. Patients returning from malarial areas are 
      also exposed to other tropical diseases which have features in common with malaria, 
      e.g., typhoid fever, dengue fever, chikungunya fever. However, there are a few key 
      findings that clinically differentiate these infections from malaria. We present a 
      case of a traveler with fever returning from India without localizing signs with 
      persistent monocytosis initially thought to have malaria.

TI  - Arboviruses of human health significance in Papua New Guinea.
PG  - 35-44
AB  - Arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) are important emerging pathogens in many 
      tropical and developing countries of the world. The Southeast Asian and Western 
      Pacific regions have recently experienced large outbreaks of dengue, Japanese 
      encephalitis and chikungunya fever. In Papua New Guinea (PNG) serological surveys 
      and mosquito isolation experiments suggest that arboviruses are prevalent throughout 
      the country. However, the lack of surveillance and clinical reporting means that the 
      distribution and prevalence of these diseases is unknown. In this paper we review 
      the most important arboviruses with regard to human health in the PNG region.

      clinical and biological features during an outbreak that occurred in Franceville, 
      Gabon in 2010. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We collected, in suspect cases 
      (individuals presenting with at least one of the following symptoms or signs: fever, 
      arthralgias, myalgias, headaches, rash, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
      bleeding, or jaundice), blood samples, demographic and clinical characteristics and 
      outcome. Hematological and biochemical tests, blood smears for malaria parasites and 
      quantitative PCR for CHIKV then dengue virus were performed. CHIKV+ patients with 
      concomitant malaria and/or dengue were excluded from the study. From May to July 
      2010, data on 270 laboratory-confirmed CHIK patients were recorded. Fever and 
      arthralgias were reported by respectively 85% and 90% of patients, while myalgias, 
      rash and hemorrhage were noted in 73%, 42% and 2% of patients. The patients were 
      grouped into 4 clinical categories depending on the existence of fever and/or joint 
      pain. On this basis, mixed forms accounted for 78.5% of cases, arthralgic forms 
      12.6%, febrile forms 6.7% and unusual forms (without fever and arthralgias) 2.2%. No 
      cases of organ failure or death were reported. Elevated liver enzyme and creatinine 
      levels, anemia and lymphocytopenia were the predominant biological abnormalities, 
      and lymphocytopenia was more severe in patients with high viral loads (p = 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: During CHIK epidemics, some patients may not have 
      classical symptoms. The existence of unusual forms and the absence of severe forms 
      of CHIK call for surveillance to detect any change in pathogenicity.

AB  - Fusion process is known to be the initial step of viral infection and hence 
      targeting the entry process is a promising strategy to design antiviral therapy. The 
      self-inhibitory peptides derived from the enveloped (E) proteins function to inhibit 
      the protein-protein interactions in the membrane fusion step mediated by the viral E 
      protein. Thus, they have the potential to be developed into effective antiviral 
      therapy. Herein, we have developed a Monte Carlo-based computational method with the 
      aim to identify and optimize potential peptide hits from the E proteins. The 
      stability of the peptides, which indicates their potential to bind in situ to the E 
      proteins, was evaluated by two different scoring functions, dipolar distance-scaled, 
      finite, ideal-gas reference state and residue-specific all-atom probability 
      discriminatory function. The method was applied to α-helical Class I HIV-1 gp41, 
      β-sheet Class II Dengue virus (DENV) type 2 E proteins, as well as Class III Herpes 
      Simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein, a E protein with a mixture of α-helix and 
      β-sheet structural fold. The peptide hits identified are in line with the druggable 
      regions where the self-inhibitory peptide inhibitors for the three classes of viral 
      fusion proteins were derived. Several novel peptides were identified from either the 
      hydrophobic regions or the functionally important regions on Class II DENV-2 E 
      protein and Class III HSV-1 gB. They have potential to disrupt the protein-protein 
      interaction in the fusion process and may serve as starting points for the 
      development of novel inhibitors for viral E proteins.

AB  - Certain infectious agents are associated with lymphomas, but the strength of the 
      association varies geographically, suggesting that local environmental factors make 
      important contributions to lymphomagenesis. Endemic Burkitt's Lymphoma has 
      well-defined environmental requirements making it particularly suitable for research 
      into local environmental factors. The Epstein-Barr virus and holoendemic Malaria are 
      recognized as important cofactors in endemic Burkitt's Lymphoma and their 
      contributions are discussed. Additionally, infection with Chikungunya Fever, a 
      potentially oncogenic arbovirus, was associated with the onset of endemic Burkitt's 
      Lymphoma in one study and also with space-time case clusters of the lymphoma. 
      Chikungunya Virus has several characteristics typical of oncogenic viruses. The 
      Flavivirus, Hepatitis C, a Class 1 Human Carcinogen, closely related to the 
      arboviruses, Yellow Fever, and Dengue, is also more distantly related to Chikungunya 
      Virus. The mechanisms of oncogenesis believed to operate in Hepatitis C 
      lymphomagenesis are discussed, as is their potential applicability to Chikungunya 
      Virus.

TI  - Replacement of conserved or variable sequences of the mosquito-borne dengue virus 3' 
      UTR with homologous sequences from Modoc virus does not change infectivity for 
      mosquitoes.
PG  - 783-788
LID - 10.1099/vir.0.046664-0 [doi]
AB  - The genus Flavivirus includes both vector-borne and no known vector (NKV) species, 
      but the molecular determinants of transmission mode are not known. Conserved 
      sequence differences between the two groups occur in 5' and 3' UTRs. To investigate 
      the impact of these differences on transmission, chimeric genomes were generated, in 
      which UTRs, UTRs+capsid, or the upper 3' UTR stem-loop of mosquito-borne dengue 
      virus (DENV) were replaced with homologous regions from NKV Modoc virus (MODV); the 
      conserved pentanucleotide sequence (CPS) was also deleted from the DENV genome. 
      Virus was not recovered following transfection of these genomes in three different 
      cell types. However, DENV genomes in which the CPS or variable region (VR) of the 3' 
      UTR were replaced with MODV sequences were recovered and infected Aedes aegypti 
      mosquitoes with similar efficiencies to DENV. These results demonstrate that neither 
      vector-borne CPS nor VR is required for vector-borne transmission.

TI  - Targeting gene expression to the female larval fat body of transgenic Aedes aegypti 
      mosquitoes.
PG  - 18-30
LID - 10.1111/imb.12005 [doi]
AB  - As the fat body is a critical tissue for mosquito development, metamorphosis, immune 
      and reproductive system function, the characterization of regulatory modules 
      targeting gene expression to the female mosquito fat body at distinct life stages is 
      much needed for multiple, varied strategies for controlling vector-borne diseases 
      such as dengue and malaria. The hexameric storage protein, Hexamerin-1.2, of the 
      mosquito Aedes atropalpus is female-specific and uniquely expressed in the fat body 
      of fourth instar larvae and young adults. We have identified in the Hex-1.2 gene, a 
      short regulatory module that directs female-, tissue-, and stage-specific lacZ 
      reporter gene expression using a heterologous promoter in transgenic lines of the 
      dengue vector Aedes aegypti. Male transgenic larvae and pupae of one line expressed 
      no Escherichia coli β-galactosidase or transgene product; in two other lines 
      reporter gene activity was highly female-biased. All transgenic lines expressed the 
      reporter only in the fat body; however, lacZ mRNA levels were no different in males 
      and females at any stage examined, suggesting that the gene regulatory module drives 
      female-specific expression by post-transcriptional regulation in the heterologous 
      mosquito. This regulatory element from the Hex-1.2 gene thus provides a new 
      molecular tool for transgenic mosquito control as well as functional genetic 
      analysis in aedine mosquitoes.

TI  - In vitro erythrocyte membrane stabilization properties of Carica papaya L. leaf 
      extracts.
PG  - 196-202
LID - 10.4103/0974-8490.102261 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carica papaya L. fruit juice and leaf extracts are known to have many 
      beneficial medical properties. Recent reports have claimed possible beneficial 
      effects of C. papaya L. leaf juice in treating patients with dengue viral 
      infections. This study aims to evaluate the membrane stabilization potential of C. 
      papaya L. leaf extracts using an in vitro hemolytic assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      The study was conducted in between June and August 2010. Two milliliters of blood 
      from healthy volunteers and patients with serologically confirmed current dengue 
      infection were freshly collected and used in the assays. Fresh papaya leaves at 
      three different maturity stages (immature, partly matured, and matured) were cleaned 
      with distilled water, crushed, and the juice was extracted with 10 ml of cold 
      distilled water. Freshly prepared cold water extracts of papaya leaves (1 ml 
      containing 30 μl of papaya leaf extracts, 20 μl from 40% erythrocytes suspension, 
      and 950 μl of phosphate buffered saline) were used in the heat-induced and 
      hypotonic-induced hemolytic assays. In dose response experiments, six different 
      concentrations (9.375, 18.75, 37.5, 75, 150, and 300 μg/ml) of freeze dried extracts 
      of the partly matured leaves were used. Membrane stabilization properties were 
      investigated with heat-induced and hypotonicity-induced hemolysis assays. RESULTS: 
      Extracts of papaya leaves of all three maturity levels showed a significant 
      reduction in heat-induced hemolysis compared to controls (P < 0.05). Papaya leaf 
      extracts of all three maturity levels showed more than 25% inhibition at a 
      concentration of 37.5 μg/ml. The highest inhibition of heat-induced hemolysis was 
      observed at 37.5 μg/ml. Inhibition activity of different maturity levels was not 
      significantly (P < 0.05) different from one another. Heat-induced hemolysis 
      inhibition activity did not demonstrate a linear dose response relationship. At 37.5 
      μg/ml concentration of the extract, a marked inhibition of hypotonicity-induced 
      hemolysis was observed. CONCLUSION: C. papaya L. leaf extracts showed a significant 
      inhibition of hemolysis in vitro and could have a potential therapeutic effect on 
      disease processes causing destabilization of biological membranes.

TI  - Salinity-tolerant larvae of mosquito vectors in the tropical coast of Jaffna, Sri 
      Lanka and the effect of salinity on the toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis to Aedes 
      aegypti larvae.
PG  - 269
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-269 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue, chikungunya, malaria, filariasis and Japanese encephalitis are 
      common mosquito-borne diseases endemic to Sri Lanka. Aedes aegypti and Aedes 
      albopictus, the major vectors of dengue, were recently shown to undergo pre-imaginal 
      development in brackish water bodies in the island. A limited survey of selected 
      coastal localities of the Jaffna district in northern Sri Lanka was carried out to 
      identify mosquito species undergoing pre-imaginal development in brackish and saline 
      waters. The effect of salinity on the toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis 
      larvicide to Ae. aegypti larvae at salinity levels naturally tolerated by Ae. 
      aegypti was examined. METHODS: Larvae collected at the selected sites along the 
      Jaffna coast were identified and salinity of habitat water determined in the 
      laboratory. The LC₅₀ and LC₉₀ of B. thuringiensis toxin, the active ingredient of a 
      commercial formulation of the larvicide BACTIVEC®, were determined with Ae. aegypti 
      larvae. Bioassays were also carried out at salinities varying from 0 to 18 ppt to 
      determine the toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis to fresh and brackish water-derived 
      larvae of Ae. aegypti. RESULTS: Larvae of four Anopheles, two Aedes, one Culex and 
      one Lutzia species were collected from brackish and saline sites with salinity in 
      the range 2 to 68 ppt. The LC₅₀ and LC₉₀ of B. thuringiensis toxin for the second 
      instar larvae of Ae. aegypti in fresh water were 0.006 ppm and 0.013 ppm 
      respectively, with corresponding values for brackish water populations of 0.008 and 
      0.012 ppm respectively. One hundred percent survival of second instar fresh water 
      and brackish water-derived Ae. aegypti larvae was recorded at salinity up to 10 and 
      12 ppt and 100% mortality at 16 and 18 ppt, yielding an LC₉₀ for salinity of 13.9 
      ppt and 15.4 ppt at 24 h post-treatment respectively for the two populations. 
      Statistical analysis showed significantly reduced toxicity of B. thuringiensis to 
      fresh and brackish water-derived Ae. aegypti larvae at high salinities. CONCLUSION: 
      A variety of mosquito vectors of human diseases undergo pre-imaginal development in 
      brackish or saline waters in coastal areas of the Jaffna district in northern Sri 
      Lanka. Salinity has a small but significant negative impact on the toxicity of B. 
      thuringiensis toxin to Ae. aegypti larvae at salinity levels where Ae. aegypti 
      larvae are found in the environment. This has implications for the use of B. 
      thuringiensis toxin as a larvicide in brackish waters.

TI  - Novel synthetic Medea selfish genetic elements drive population replacement in 
      Drosophila; a theoretical exploration of Medea-dependent population suppression.
PG  - 915-28
LID - 10.1021/sb300079h [doi]
AB  - Insects act as vectors for diseases of plants, animals, and humans. Replacement of 
      wild insect populations with genetically modified individuals unable to transmit 
      disease provides a potentially self-perpetuating method of disease prevention. 
      Population replacement requires a gene drive mechanism in order to spread linked 
      genes mediating disease refractoriness through wild populations. We previously 
      reported the creation of synthetic Medea selfish genetic elements able to drive 
      population replacement in Drosophila. These elements use microRNA-mediated silencing 
      of myd88, a maternally expressed gene required for embryonic dorso-ventral pattern 
      formation, coupled with early zygotic expression of a rescuing transgene, to bring 
      about gene drive. Medea elements that work through additional mechanisms are needed 
      in order to be able to carry out cycles of population replacement and/or remove 
      existing transgenes from the population, using second-generation elements that 
      spread while driving first-generation elements out of the population. Here we report 
      the synthesis and population genetic behavior of two new synthetic Medea elements 
      that drive population replacement through manipulation of signaling pathways 
      involved in cellular blastoderm formation or Notch signaling, demonstrating that in 
      Drosophila Medea elements can be generated through manipulation of diverse signaling 
      pathways. We also describe the mRNA and small RNA changes in ovaries and early 
      embryos associated from Medea-bearing females. Finally, we use modeling to 
      illustrate how Medea elements carrying genes that result in diapause-dependent 
      female lethality could be used to bring about population suppression.

AB  - Viral fitness is an active area of research, with recent work involving an expanded 
      number of human, non-human vertebrate, invertebrate, plant, and bacterial viruses. 
      Many publications deal with RNA viruses associated with major disease emergence 
      events, such as HIV-1, influenza virus, and Dengue virus. Study topics include drug 
      resistance, immune escape, viral emergence, host jumps, mutation effects, 
      quasispecies diversity, and mathematical models of viral fitness. Important recent 
      trends include increasing use of in vivo systems to assess vertebrate virus fitness, 
      and a broadening of research beyond replicative fitness to also investigate 
      transmission fitness and epidemiologic fitness. This is essential for a more 
      integrated understanding of overall viral fitness, with implications for disease 
      management in the future.

TI  - [Rickettsiosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients having 
      fever related to travelling].
PG  - 1525-8
AB  - Rickettsial diseases are increasingly reported in international travellers. 
      Prospective studies have shown that 2-4 % of travellers returning with fever have a 
      rickettsiosis. We discuss epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnostics, treatment 
      and prevention of rickettsiosis. In conclusion, rickettsiosis should be considered 
      in the returned traveller with fever, especially when malaria, dengue fever and 
      typhoid fever have been excluded. There is a possibility that doxycycline may have a 
      prophylactic effect on rickettsiosis, but this thesis is only imaginary and needs 
      further investigation.

      (Euphorbiaceae) leaf extract against the malarial vector, Anopheles stephensi, 
      dengue vector, Aedes aegypti and Bancroftian filariasis vector, Culex

AB  - The leaf extract of Acalypha alnifolia with different solvents - hexane, chloroform, 
      ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol - were tested for larvicidal activity against 
      three important mosquitoes such as malarial vector, Anopheles stephensi, dengue 
      vector, Aedes aegypti and Bancroftian filariasis vector, Culex quinquefasciatus. The 
      medicinal plants were collected from the area around Kallar Hills near the Western 
      Ghats, Coimbatore, India. A. alnifolia plant was washed with tap water and shade 
      dried at room temperature. The dried leaves were powdered mechanically using 
      commercial electrical stainless steel blender. The powder 800 g of the leaf material 
      was extract with 2.5 litre of various each organic solvents such as hexane, 
      chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol for 8 h using Soxhlet apparatus, and 
      filtered. The crude plant extracts were evaporated to dryness in a rotary vacuum 
      evaporator. The yield of extracts was hexane (8.64 g), chloroform (10.74 g), ethyl 
      acetate (9.14 g), acetone (10.02 g), and methanol (11.43 g). One gram of the each 
      plant residue was dissolved separately in 100 ml of acetone (stock solution) from 
      which different concentrations, i.e., 50, 150, 250, 350 and 450 ppm, was prepared. 
      The hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone was moderate considerable mortality; 
      however, the highest larval mortality was methanolic extract observed in three 
      mosquito vectors. The larval mortality was observed after 24 h exposure. No 
      mortality was observed in the control. The early fourth-instar larvae of A. 
      stephensi had values of LC(50) = 197.37, 178.75, 164.34, 149.90 and 125.73 ppm and 
      LC(90) = 477.60, 459.21, 435.07, 416.20 and 395.50 ppm, respectively. The A. aegypti 
      had values of LC(50) = 202.15, 182.58, 160.35, 146.07 and 128.55 ppm and 
      LC(90) = 476.57, 460.83, 440.78, 415.38 and 381.67 ppm, respectively. The C. 
      quinquefasciatus had values of LC(50) = 198.79, 172.48, 151.06, 140.69 and 127.98 
      ppm and LC(90) = 458.73, 430.66, 418.78, 408.83 and 386.26 ppm, respectively. The 
      results of the leaf extract of A. alnifloia are promising as good larvicidal 
      activity against the mosquito vector, A. stephensi, A. aegypti, C. quinquefasciatus. 
      Therefore, this study provides first report on the larvicidal activities against 
      three species of mosquito vectors of this plant extracts from Southern India.

AB  - Aedes aegypti is an important vector of the viruses that cause dengue fever, dengue 
      haemorrhagic fever and yellow fever. Reverse genetic approaches to the study of gene 
      function in this mosquito have been limited by the lack of a robust inducible 
      promoter to allow precise temporal control over a protein-encoding or hairpin RNA 
      transgene. Likewise, investigations into the molecular and biochemical basis of 
      vector competence would benefit from the ability to activate an antipathogen 
      molecule at specific times during infection. We have characterized the ability of 
      genomic sequences derived from two Ae. aegypti heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) genes 
      to drive heat-inducible expression of a reporter in both transient and germline 
      transformation contexts. AaHsp70-luciferase transcripts accumulated specifically 
      after heat shock, and displayed a pattern of rapid induction and decay similar to 
      endogenous AaHsp70 genes. Luciferase expression in transgenic Ae. aegypti increased 
      by ~25-50-fold in whole adults by 4 h after heat-shock, with significant activity 
      (~20-fold) remaining at 24 h. Heat-induced expression was even more dramatic in 
      midgut tissues, with one strain showing a ~2500-fold increase in luciferase 
      activity. The AaHsp70 promoters described could be valuable for gene function 
      studies as well as for the precise timing of the expression of antipathogen 
      molecules.

TI  - Bdelloid rotifer, Philodina species in the breeding containers of Aedes aegypti and 
      Aedes albopictus.
PG  - 646-9
AB  - The vector mosquitoes of dengue and chikungunya fever, Aedes aegypti and Aedes 
      albopictus have adapted to feed on humans and undergo larval and pupal development 
      in natural and artificial freshwater collections. Although several studies reported, 
      still, much information is required to understand the successful survival of Aedes 
      mosquitoes in small temporary containers. In an investigation conducted in the 
      chikungunya affected areas of Kerala state, India, the presence of Bdelloid rotifer, 
      Philodina in 95% of breeding habitats of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus was 
      recorded. The role of Philodina in the breeding containers was investigated. It was 
      found that while in control the number of Philodina was found increasing in the 
      water sample during the study period of seven days, the number found decreased in 
      the containers with larvae of Aedes. The gut content analysis also confirmed the 
      presence of the rotating wheel, corona of Philodina in some of the specimen suggests 
      its role as major larval food.

TI  - Identification of a novel antiviral inhibitor of the flavivirus guanylyltransferase 
      enzyme.
PG  - 8730-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00384-12 [doi]
AB  - Arthropod-borne flavivirus infection causes serious morbidity and mortality 
      worldwide, but there are currently no effective antiflaviviral chemotherapeutics 
      available for human use. Therefore, it is critical that new therapeutics against 
      virus-specific targets be developed. To identify new compounds that may be used as 
      broadly active flavivirus therapeutics, we have performed a high-throughput 
      screening of 235,456 commercially available compounds for small-molecule inhibitors 
      of the dengue virus NS5 RNA capping enzyme. We identified a family of compounds, the 
      2-thioxothiazolidin-4-ones, that show potent biochemical inhibition of capping 
      enzyme GTP binding and guanylyltransferase function. During the course of 
      structure-activity relationship analysis, a molecule within this family, 
      (E)-{3-[5-(4-tert-butylbenzylidene)-4-oxo-2-thioxo-1,3-thiazolidin-3-yl]propanoic 
      acid} (BG-323), was found to possess significant antiviral activity in a dengue 
      virus subgenomic replicon assay. Further testing of BG-323 demonstrated that this 
      molecule is able to reduce the replication of infectious West Nile virus and yellow 
      fever virus in cell culture with low toxicity. The results of this study describe 
      the first inhibitor that targets the GTP-binding/guanylyltransferase activity of the 
      flavivirus RNA capping enzyme.

AB  - Flavivirus is a genus of the family Flaviviridae. It includes West Nile virus (WNV), 
      dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), 
      tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and several other viruses which lead to 
      extensive morbidity and mortality in humans. To establish infection and replication 
      in the hosts, flaviviruses have evolved a variety of strategies to modulate the 
      host's immune responses. In this review, the strategies employed by flaviviruses to 
      evade the innate and adaptive immunity of host are summarized based on current 
      studies, with a major focus on the inhibition of interferon, complement, natural 
      killer (NK) cell, B cell, and T cell responses. This review aims to provide an 
      overview of the current understanding for the mechanisms used by flaviviruses to 
      escape the host's immune response, which will facilitate the future studies on 
      flavivirus pathogenesis and the development of anti-flavivirus therapeutics.

TI  - Genetically modified mosquito: the Malaysian public engagement experience.
PG  - 1323-7
LID - 10.1002/biot.201200282 [doi]
AB  - On December 21, 2010, 6000 genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes were released in an 
      uninhabited forest in Malaysia. The purpose of the deliberate release was a limited 
      “marked release and recapture” (MRR) experiment, a standard ecological method in 
      entomology, to evaluate under field conditions, the flight distance and longevity of 
      the sterile male Aedes aegypti strain OX513A(My1), a GM strain. As with any other GM 
      technologies, the release was received with mixed responses. As the scientific 
      community debate over the public engagement strategies for similar GM releases, 
      dengue incidence continues to rise with a heavy toll on morbidity, mortality and 
      healthcare budgets. Meanwhile the wild female Aedes aegypti continues to breed 
      offspring, surviving and evading conventional interventions for vector control.

TI  - Climate change and human health: Indian context.
PG  - 55-60
AB  - The article reviews the issue of climate change and health in the Indian context. 
      The importance of climate change leading to estimated loss of above 2.5 million 
      DALYs in southeast Asia, mortality due to heat waves, and the importance of air 
      quality related respiratory diseases, disasters due to excessive floods, 
      malnutrition due to reduction in rice, maize and sorghum crops etc. Latest work 
      undertaken in India, vis-a-vis current scenario and need for further work has been 
      discussed. There is felt need of further studies on assessing the impact on dengue 
      and chikungunya as the transmission dynamics of these diseases involve water 
      availability, storage and life style, etc. Uncertainties and knowledge gaps 
      identified in the studies undertaken so far have also been highlighted. As regards 
      to vector borne diseases, there is a need to concentrate in the areas which are 
      presently free from malaria and with use of best available tools of interventions in 
      already disease endemic areas like northeastern states, the risk of climate change 
      impacts can be minimized.

      implication in pathogen transmission.
PG  - 61-71
LID - 10.1007/s00436-011-2449-6 [doi]
AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are important vectors of human disease-causing 
      pathogens. Mosquitoes are found both in rural and urban areas. Deteriorating 
      infrastructure, poor access to health, water and sanitation services, increasing 
      population density, and widespread poverty contribute to conditions that modify the 
      environment, which directly influences the risk of disease within the urban and 
      peri-urban ecosystem. The objective of this study was to evaluate the mosquito 
      vector abundance and diversity in urban, peri-urban, and rural strata in Malindi 
      along the Kenya coast. The study was conducted in the coastal district of Malindi 
      between January and December 2005. Three strata were selected which were described 
      as urban, peri-urban, and rural. Sampling was done during the wet and dry seasons. 
      Sampling in the wet season was done in the months of April and June to cover the 
      long rainy season and in November and December to cover the short rainy season, 
      while the dry season was between January and March and September and October. Adult 
      mosquito collection was done using Pyrethrum Spray Collection (PSC) and Centers for 
      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps inside houses and specimens were 
      identified morphologically. In the three strata (urban, peri-urban, and rural), 
      78.5% of the total mosquito (n = 7,775) were collected using PSC while 18.1% 
      (n = 1,795) were collected using the CDC light traps. Using oviposition traps, 
      mosquito eggs were collected and reared in the insectary which yielded 329 adults of 
      which 83.8% (n = 276) were Aedes aegypti and 16.2% (n = 53) were Culex 
      quinquefasciatus. The mosquito distribution in the three sites varied significantly 
      in each collection site. Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles funestus and Anopheles 
      coustani were predominant in the rural stratum while C. quinquefasciatus was mostly 
      found in urban and peri-urban strata. However, using PSC and CDC light trap 
      collection techniques, A. aegypti was only found in urban strata. In the three 
      strata, mosquitoes were mainly found in high numbers during the wet season. Further, 
      A. gambiae, C. quinquefasciatus, and A. aegypti mosquitoes were found occurring 
      together inside the houses. This in turn exposes the inhabitants to an array of 
      mosquito-borne diseases including malaria, bancroftian filariasis, and arboviruses 
      (dengue fever, Yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, Chikungunya fever, and West Nile 
      Virus). In conclusion, our findings provide useful information for the design of 
      integrated mosquito and disease control programs in East African environments.

AB  - The first symptoms of malaria, common to all the different malaria species, are 
      nonspecific and mimic a flu-like syndrome. Although fever represents the cardinal 
      feature, clinical findings in malaria are extremely diverse and may range in 
      severity from mild headache to serious complications leading to death, particularly 
      in falciparum malaria. As the progression to these complications can be rapid, any 
      malaria patient must be assessed and treated rapidly, and frequent observations are 
      needed to look for early signs of systemic complications.In fact, severe malaria is 
      a life threatening but treatable disease. The protean and nonspecific clinical 
      findings occurring in malaria (fever, malaise, headache, myalgias, jaundice and 
      sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) may lead 
      physicians who see malaria infrequently to a wrong diagnosis, such as influenza 
      (particularly during the seasonal epidemic flu), dengue, gastroenteritis, typhoid 
      fever, viral hepatitis, encephalitis. Physicians should be aware that malaria is not 
      a clinical diagnosis but must be diagnosed, or excluded, by performing microscopic 
      examination of blood films. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are then 
      crucial to prevent morbidity and fatal outcomes. Although Plasmodium falciparum 
      malaria is the major cause of severe malaria and death, increasing evidence has 
      recently emerged that Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi can also be severe 
      and even fatal.

PG  - 116-20
AB  - Distributed systems and grid computing systems are used to connect several computers 
      to obtain a higher level of performance, in order to solve a problem. During the 
      last decade, projects use the World Wide Web to aggregate individuals' CPU power for 
      research purposes. This paper presents the existing active large scale distributed 
      and grid computing projects with research focus in human health. There have been 
      found and presented 11 active projects with more than 2000 Processing Units (PUs) 
      each. The research focus for most of them is molecular biology and, specifically on 
      understanding or predicting protein structure through simulation, comparing 
      proteins, genomic analysis for disease provoking genes and drug design. Though not 
      in all cases explicitly stated, common target diseases include research to find cure 
      against HIV, dengue, Duchene dystrophy, Parkinson's disease, various types of cancer 
      and influenza. Other diseases include malaria, anthrax, Alzheimer's disease. The 
      need for national initiatives and European Collaboration for larger scale projects 
      is stressed, to raise the awareness of citizens to participate in order to create a 
      culture of internet volunteering altruism.

AB  - A number of viruses in the family Flaviviridae are the focus of efforts to develop 
      effective antiviral therapies. Success has been achieved with inhibitors for the 
      treatment of hepatitis C, and there is interest in clinical trials of drugs against 
      dengue fever. Antiviral therapies have also been evaluated in patients with Japanese 
      encephalitis and West Nile encephalitis. However, no treatment has been developed 
      against the prototype flavivirus, yellow fever virus (YFV). Despite the availability 
      of the live, attenuated 17D vaccine, thousands of cases of YF continue to occur each 
      year in Africa and South America, with a significant mortality rate. In addition, a 
      small number of vaccinees develop severe systemic infections with the 17D virus. 
      This paper reviews current efforts to develop antiviral therapies, either directly 
      targeting the virus or blocking detrimental host responses to infection.

PG  - 346-9
LID - 10.1016/j.pedn.2011.03.011 [doi]
AB  - Vector repellent is one element in the prevention of vector-borne diseases. Families 
      that neglect protecting their children against vectors risk their children 
      contracting illnesses such as West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis, Lyme 
      disease, malaria, dengue hemorrhagic fever, yellow fever, babesiosis, Crimean-Congo 
      hemorrhagic fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Southern tick-associated rash 
      illness, ehrlichiosis, tick-borne relapsing fever, tularemia, and other insect and 
      arthropod related diseases (CDC, 2011). Identification of families at risk includes 
      screening of the underlying basis for reluctance to apply insect repellent. Nurses 
      and physicians can participate in a positive role by assisting families to determine 
      the proper prophylaxis by recommending insect repellent choices that are economical, 
      safe, and easy to use. A holistic alternative might include the suggestion of clove 
      oil in cases where families might have trepidations regarding the use of DEET on 
      children. This article will explore the safety and effectiveness of clove oil and 
      its use as an insect repellent.

AB  - Emergence of viral agents in Europe is influenced by various factors. Climatic 
      changes influencing possible vectors, insufficient vaccination, and travel of man 
      and goods are among the most important reasons to explain these changes. Fever and 
      arthralgia are the leading symptoms in infection with Dengue, Sindbis, or 
      Chikungunya virus. In contrast, tick-born encephalitis (TBE), Toscana, or West Nile 
      virus infections mainly lead to meningo-encephalitis. In Europe, hemorrhagic fever 
      is caused by Crimean Congo and Hanta virus. Protective vaccines are available for 
      emerging viral agents like TBE, influenza and measles.

AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti can spread the dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever 
      viruses. Thus, the search for key molecules involved in the mosquito survival 
      represents today a promising vector control strategy. High Mobility Group Box (HMGB) 
      proteins are essential nuclear factors that maintain the high-order structure of 
      chromatin, keeping eukaryotic cells viable. Outside the nucleus, secreted HMGB 
      proteins could alert the innate immune system to foreign antigens and trigger the 
      initiation of host defenses. In this work, we cloned and functionally characterized 
      the HMGB1 protein from Aedes aegypti (AaHMGB1). The AaHMGB1 protein typically 
      consists of two HMG-box DNA binding domains and an acidic C-terminus. Interestingly, 
      AaHMGB1 contains a unique alanine/glutamine-rich (AQ-rich) C-terminal region that 
      seems to be exclusive of dipteran HMGB proteins. AaHMGB1 is localized to the cell 
      nucleus, mainly associated with heterochromatin. Circular dichroism analyses of 
      AaHMGB1 or the C-terminal truncated proteins revealed α-helical structures. We 
      showed that AaHMGB1 can effectively bind and change the topology of DNA, and that 
      the AQ-rich and the C-terminal acidic regions can modulate its ability to promote 
      DNA supercoiling, as well as its preference to bind supercoiled DNA. AaHMGB1 is 
      phosphorylated by PKA and PKC, but not by CK2. Importantly, phosphorylation of 
      AaHMGB1 by PKA or PKC completely abolishes its DNA bending activity. Thus, our study 
      shows that a functional HMGB1 protein occurs in Aedes aegypt and we provide the 
      first description of a HMGB1 protein containing an AQ-rich regulatory C-terminus.

TI  - Fever in the returning traveller.
PG  - 43-6; quiz 46
LID - 10.4997/JRCPE.2012.110 [doi]
AB  - International travel is increasing and a significant number of travellers will 
      develop a febrile illness during or shortly after their return from the tropics. The 
      differential diagnosis is broad and a systematic approach to the management of these 
      patients is required in order to establish the diagnosis and to initiate prompt and 
      effective treatment. Fever may be due to infectious agents found only in tropical 
      countries, or due to infections unrelated to travel and found worldwide. Important 
      infections that should be considered in all returning travellers include malaria, 
      dengue, enteric fever, rickettsial infections, and HIV seroconversion. Other 
      diagnoses will be considered after a detailed history including countries visited 
      with dates, activities undertaken and symptoms. At a minimum, all travellers from 
      countries where there is malaria transmission should be tested repeatedly for 
      malaria as well as having several sets of blood cultures taken. Many tropical 
      infections are diagnosed serologically at specialist reference laboratories. 
      Specialist advice on the investigation and management of returning travellers should 
      be sought from infectious diseases physicians and microbiologists. Patients with 
      malaria or enteric fever may deteriorate rapidly and travellers should be advised to 
      seek prompt medical attention if they become unwell after travel to the tropics. 
      This review will focus on some of the more important imported infections, diagnostic 
      clues from the history, examination and investigations, and important considerations 
      in their management.

TI  - Morphological changes in the midgut of Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae 
      following exposure to an Annona coriacea (Magnoliales: Annonaceae) extract.
PG  - 311-4
LID - 10.1007/s13744-012-0050-z [doi]
AB  - Bioinsecticides are important in the control of disease vectors, but data regarding 
      their physiological effects on target insects are incomplete. This study describes 
      morphological changes that occur in the midgut of third instar Aedes aegypti L. 
      (Diptera: Culicidae) following treatment with a methanolic extract of Annona 
      coriacea (Magnoliales: Annonaceae). Dissected midguts were subdivided into anterior 
      and posterior regions and analyzed by light and scanning electron microscopy. 
      Insects exposed to the extract displayed intense, destructive cytoplasmic 
      vacuolization in columnar and regenerative midgut cells. The apical surfaces of 
      columnar cells exhibited cytoplasmic protrusions oriented toward the lumen, 
      suggesting that these cells could be involved in apocrine secretory processes and/or 
      apoptosis. We report that A. coriacea extracts induced morphological alterations in 
      the midgut of A. aegypti midgut larvae, supporting the use of plant extracts for 
      control of the dengue vector.

TI  - Silica nanoparticle: a potential new insecticide for mosquito vector control.
PG  - 1075-83
LID - 10.1007/s00436-012-2934-6 [doi]
AB  - Presently, there is a need for increased efforts to develop newer and effective 
      methods to control mosquito vectors as the existing chemical and biological methods 
      are not as effective as in earlier period owing to different technical and 
      operational reasons. The use of nanomaterial products in various sectors of science 
      including health increased during the last decade. We tested three types of 
      nanosilica, namely lipophilic, hydrophilic and hydrophobic, to assess their 
      larvicidal, pupicidal and growth inhibitor properties and also their influence on 
      oviposition behaviour (attraction/deterrence) of mosquito species that transmit 
      human diseases, namely malaria (Anopheles), yellow fever, chickungunya and dengue 
      (Aedes), lymphatic filariasis and encephalitis (Culex and Aedes). Application of 
      hydrophobic nanosilica at 112.5 ppm was found effective against mosquito species 
      tested. The larvicidal effect of hydrophobic nanosilica on mosquito species tested 
      was in the order of Anopheles stephensi > Aedes aegypti > Culex quinquefasciatus, 
      and the pupicidal effect was in the order of A. stephensi > C. quinquefasciatus > 
      Ae. aegypti. Results of combined treatment of hydrophobic nanosilica with temephos 
      in larvicidal test indicated independent toxic action without any additive effect. 
      This is probably the first report that demonstrated that nanoparticles particularly 
      nanosilica could be used in mosquito vector control.

TI  - A review of the invasive mosquitoes in Europe: ecology, public health risks, and 
      control options.
PG  - 435-47
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2011.0814 [doi]
AB  - There has been growing interest in Europe in recent years in the establishment and 
      spread of invasive mosquitoes, notably the incursion of Aedes albopictus through the 
      international trade in used tires and lucky bamboo, with onward spread within Europe 
      through ground transport. More recently, five other non-European aedine mosquito 
      species have been found in Europe, and in some cases populations have established 
      locally and are spreading. Concerns have been raised about the involvement of these 
      mosquito species in transmission cycles of pathogens of public health importance, 
      and these concerns were borne out following the outbreak of chikungunya fever in 
      Italy in 2007, and subsequent autochthonous cases of dengue fever in France and 
      Croatia in 2010. This article reviews current understanding of all exotic (five 
      introduced invasive and one intercepted) aedine species in Europe, highlighting the 
      known import pathways, biotic and abiotic constraints for establishment, control 
      strategies, and public health significance, and encourages Europe-wide surveillance 
      for invasive mosquitoes.

LID - 10.1007/s40011-011-0001-1 [doi]
AB  - Despite an elaborate armamentarium to tackle microbes, emerging infectious diseases 
      remain a crucial global challenge. Emerging infections can be defined as "infections 
      that have newly appeared in a population or have existed previously but are rapidly 
      increasing in incidence or geographic range." Several factors like increase in 
      international travel and trade, human encroachment on wild-life habitats, changes in 
      agricultural practices and wild-life trade have contributed to the emergence of 
      pathogens. Emergence/re-emergence of several viral infections has been reported from 
      India in the past few decades; some of the important emerging viral infections are 
      discussed in this review. They include infection due to Nipah, Hantaviruses, 
      Chikungunya, Human Enterovirus-71, Influenza, Chandipura, Crimean Congo, SARS 
      Coronavirus, Buffalopox, Dengue and Japanese Encephalitis viruses. Creating 
      increased awareness and training of clinical microbiologists/virologists for 
      identification of new/emerging pathogens, and prompt reporting and management of 
      outbreaks is essential to tackle the threat posed by emerging/re-emerging 
      infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Culex is an important mosquito as vectors for the transmission of 
      serious diseases, such as filariasis, West Nile virus, dengue, yellow fever, 
      chikungunya and other encephalitides. Nearly one billion people in the developing 
      countries are at risk. In order to discover new bioactive molecules and pesticides 
      acting on mosquito, we designed active amide structure and synthesized a series of 
      novel diamide derivatives. RESULTS: A series of novel diamide derivatives were 
      designed and synthesized. Their structures were characterized by 1 H NMR, FTIR and 
      HRMS. The single crystal structure of compound 6n was determined to further 
      elucidate the structure. Biological activities of these compounds were tested. Most 
      of them exhibited higher mosquito larvicidal activity. Especially compound 6r 
      displayed relatively good activity to reach 70% at 2 μg/mL. CONCLUSION: A practical 
      synthetic route to amide derivatives by the reaction of amide with another acid is 
      presented. This study suggests that the diamide derivatives exhibited good effective 
      against mosquito.

TI  - Optimal control of chikungunya disease: larvae reduction, treatment and prevention.
PG  - 369-92
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2012.9.369 [doi]
AB  - Since the 1980s, there has been a worldwide re-emergence of vector-borne diseases 
      including Malaria, Dengue, Yellow fever or, more recently, chikungunya. These 
      viruses are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by arthropods like 
      mosquitoes of Aedes genus. The nature of these arboviruses is complex since it 
      conjugates human, environmental, biological and geographical factors. Recent 
      researchs have suggested, in particular during the Reunion Island epidemic in 2006, 
      that the transmission by Aedes albopictus (an Aedes genus specie) has been 
      facilitated by genetic mutations of the virus and the vector capacity to adapt to 
      non tropical regions. In this paper we formulate an optimal control problem, based 
      on biological observations. Three main efforts are considered in order to limit the 
      virus transmission. Indeed, there is no vaccine nor specific treatment against 
      chikungunya, that is why the main measures to limit the impact of such epidemic have 
      to be considered. Therefore, we look at time dependent breeding sites destruction, 
      prevention and treatment efforts, for which optimal control theory is applied. Using 
      analytical and numerical techniques, it is shown that there exist cost effective 
      control efforts.

TI  - Plant extracts as potential mosquito larvicides.
PG  - 581-98
AB  - Mosquitoes act as a vector for most of the life threatening diseases like malaria, 
      yellow fever, dengue fever, chikungunya ferver, filariasis, encephalitis, West Nile 
      Virus infection, etc. Under the Integrated Mosquito Management (IMM), emphasis was 
      given on the application of alternative strategies in mosquito control. The 
      continuous application of synthetic insecticides causes development of resistance in 
      vector species, biological magnification of toxic substances through the food chain 
      and adverse effects on environmental quality and non target organisms including 
      human health. Application of active toxic agents from plant extracts as an 
      alternative mosquito control strategy was available from ancient times. These are 
      non-toxic, easily available at affordable prices, biodegradable and show 
      broad-spectrum target-specific activities against different species of vector 
      mosquitoes. In this article, the current state of knowledge on phytochemical sources 
      and mosquitocidal activity, their mechanism of action on target population, 
      variation of their larvicidal activity according to mosquito species, instar 
      specificity, polarity of solvents used during extraction, nature of active 
      ingredient and promising advances made in biological control of mosquitoes by plant 
      derived secondary metabolites have been reviewed.

TI  - Gal4-based enhancer-trapping in the malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 1305-15
LID - 10.1534/g3.112.003582 [doi]
AB  - Transposon-based forward and reverse genetic technologies will contribute greatly to 
      ongoing efforts to study mosquito functional genomics. A piggyBac transposon-based 
      enhancer-trap system was developed that functions efficiently in the human malaria 
      vector, Anopheles stephensi. The system consists of six transgenic lines of 
      Anopheles stephensi, each with a single piggyBac-Gal4 element in a unique genomic 
      location; six lines with a single piggyBac-UAStdTomato element; and two lines, each 
      with a single Minos element containing the piggyBac-transposase gene under the 
      regulatory control of the hsp70 promoter from Drosophila melanogaster. Enhancer 
      detection depended upon the efficient remobilization of piggyBac-Gal4 transposons, 
      which contain the yeast transcription factor gene Gal4 under the regulatory control 
      of a basal promoter. Gal4 expression was detected through the expression of the 
      fluorescent protein gene tdTomato under the regulatory control of a promoter with 
      Gal4-binding UAS elements. From five genetic screens for larval- and adult-specific 
      enhancers, 314 progeny were recovered from 24,250 total progeny (1.3%) with unique 
      patterns of tdTomato expression arising from the influence of an enhancer. The 
      frequency of piggyBac remobilization and enhancer detection was 2.5- to 3-fold 
      higher in female germ lines compared with male germ lines. A small collection of 
      enhancer-trap lines are described in which Gal4 expression occurred in adult female 
      salivary glands, midgut, and fat body, either singly or in combination. These three 
      tissues play critical roles during the infection of Anopheles stephensi by 
      malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites. This system and the lines generated using it 
      will be valuable resources to ongoing mosquito functional genomics efforts.

TI  - Interferon response factors 3 and 7 protect against Chikungunya virus hemorrhagic 
      fever and shock.
PG  - 9888-98
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00956-12 [doi]
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections can produce severe disease and mortality. Here 
      we show that CHIKV infection of adult mice deficient in interferon response factors 
      3 and 7 (IRF3/7(-/-)) is lethal. Mortality was associated with undetectable levels 
      of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) in serum, ∼50- and ∼10-fold increases in levels 
      of IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), respectively, increased virus replication, 
      edema, vasculitis, hemorrhage, fever followed by hypothermia, oliguria, 
      thrombocytopenia, and raised hematocrits. These features are consistent with 
      hemorrhagic shock and were also evident in infected IFN-α/β receptor-deficient mice. 
      In situ hybridization suggested CHIKV infection of endothelium, fibroblasts, 
      skeletal muscle, mononuclear cells, chondrocytes, and keratinocytes in IRF3/7(-/-) 
      mice; all but the latter two stained positive in wild-type mice. Vaccination 
      protected IRF3/7(-/-) mice, suggesting that defective antibody responses were not 
      responsible for mortality. IPS-1- and TRIF-dependent pathways were primarily 
      responsible for IFN-α/β induction, with IRF7 being upregulated >100-fold in infected 
      wild-type mice. These studies suggest that inadequate IFN-α/β responses following 
      virus infection can be sufficient to induce hemorrhagic fever and shock, a finding 
      with implications for understanding severe CHIKV disease and dengue hemorrhagic 
      fever/dengue shock syndrome.

TI  - The potentiality of vanadium in medicinal applications.
PG  - 1823-37
LID - 10.4155/fmc.12.103 [doi]
AB  - In the early treatment of diabetes with vanadium, inorganic vanadium compounds have 
      been the focus of attention; organic vanadium compounds are nowadays increasingly 
      attracting attention. A key compound is bis(maltolato)oxidovanadium, which became 
      introduced into clinical tests Phase IIa. Organic ligands help modulate the 
      bioavailability, transport and targeting mechanism of a vanadium compound. Commonly, 
      however, the active onsite species is vanadyl (VO(2+)) or vanadate (H(2)VO(4) (-)), 
      generated by biospeciation. The mode of operation can be ascribed to interaction of 
      vanadate with phosphatases and kinases, and to modulation of the level of reactive 
      oxygen species interfering with phosphatases and/or DNA. This operating mode has 
      also been inferred for most cancerostatic vanadium compounds, although some, for 
      example vanadocenes, may directly intercalate with DNA. Novel medicinal potentiality 
      of vanadium compounds is geared towards endemic diseases in tropical countries, in 
      particular leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease and amoebiasis, and viral infections such 
      as Dengue fever, SARS and HIV.

PG  - 2297-309

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit numerous arboviruses including dengue and chikungunya virus 
      (CHIKV). In recent years, mosquito species Aedes albopictus has expanded in the 
      Indian Ocean region and was the principal vector of chikungunya outbreaks in La 
      Reunion and neighbouring islands in 2005 and 2006. Vector-associated bacteria have 
      recently been found to interact with transmitted pathogens. For instance, Wolbachia 
      modulates the replication of viruses or parasites. However, there has been no 
      systematic evaluation of the diversity of the entire bacterial populations within 
      mosquito individuals particularly in relation to virus invasion. Here, we 
      investigated the effect of CHIKV infection on the whole bacterial community of 
      Ae. albopictus. Taxonomic microarrays and quantitative PCR showed that members of 
      Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria phyla, as well as Bacteroidetes, responded to CHIKV 
      infection. The abundance of bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family increased 
      with CHIKV infection, whereas the abundance of known insect endosymbionts like 
      Wolbachia and Blattabacterium decreased. Our results clearly link the pathogen 
      propagation with changes in the dynamics of the bacterial community, suggesting that 
      cooperation or competition occurs within the host, which may in turn affect the 
      mosquito traits like vector competence.

TI  - Infectious diseases following natural disasters: prevention and control measures.
PG  - 95-104
LID - 10.1586/eri.11.155 [doi]
AB  - Natural disasters may lead to infectious disease outbreaks when they result in 
      substantial population displacement and exacerbate synergic risk factors (change in 
      the environment, in human conditions and in the vulnerability to existing pathogens) 
      for disease transmission. We reviewed risk factors and potential infectious diseases 
      resulting from prolonged secondary effects of major natural disasters that occurred 
      from 2000 to 2011. Natural disasters including floods, tsunamis, earthquakes, 
      tropical cyclones (e.g., hurricanes and typhoons) and tornadoes have been 
      secondarily described with the following infectious diseases including diarrheal 
      diseases, acute respiratory infections, malaria, leptospirosis, measles, dengue 
      fever, viral hepatitis, typhoid fever, meningitis, as well as tetanus and cutaneous 
      mucormycosis. Risk assessment is essential in post-disaster situations and the rapid 
      implementation of control measures through re-establishment and improvement of 
      primary healthcare delivery should be given high priority, especially in the absence 
      of pre-disaster surveillance data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus distributed throughout 
      much of Africa and Asia. Infection with the virus may cause acute febrile illness 
      that clinically resembles dengue fever. A recent study indicated the existence of 
      three geographically distinct viral lineages; however this analysis utilized only a 
      single viral gene. Although ZIKV has been known to circulate in both Africa and Asia 
      since at least the 1950s, little is known about the genetic relationships between 
      geographically distinct virus strains. Moreover, the geographic origin of the 
      strains responsible for the epidemic that occurred on Yap Island, Federated States 
      of Micronesia in 2007, and a 2010 pediatric case in Cambodia, has not been 
      determined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To elucidate the genetic relationships 
      of geographically distinct ZIKV strains and the origin of the strains responsible 
      for the 2007 outbreak on Yap Island and a 2010 Cambodian pediatric case of ZIKV 
      infection, the nucleotide sequences of the open reading frame of five isolates from 
      Cambodia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Uganda, and Senegal collected between 1947 and 2010 
      were determined. Phylogenetic analyses of these and previously published ZIKV 
      sequences revealed the existence of two main virus lineages (African and Asian) and 
      that the strain responsible for the Yap epidemic and the Cambodian case most likely 
      originated in Southeast Asia. Examination of the nucleotide and amino acid sequence 
      alignments revealed the loss of a potential glycosylation site in some of the virus 
      strains, which may correlate with the passage history of the virus. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The basal position of the ZIKV strain isolated in Malaysia 
      in 1966 suggests that the recent outbreak in Micronesia was initiated by a strain 
      from Southeast Asia. Because ZIKV infection in humans produces an illness clinically 
      similar to dengue fever and many other tropical infectious diseases, it is likely 
      greatly misdiagnosed and underreported.

TI  - Temporal variation of wing geometry in Aedes albopictus.
PG  - 1030-4
LID - S0074-02762012000800011 [pii]
AB  - Although native to the tropical and subtropical areas of Southeast Asia, Aedes 
      albopictus is now found on five continents, primarily due to its great capacity to 
      adapt to different environments. This species is considered a secondary vector of 
      dengue virus in several countries. Wing geometric morphometrics is widely used to 
      furnish morphological markers for the characterisation and identification of species 
      of medical importance and for the assessment of population dynamics. In this work, 
      we investigated the metric differentiation of the wings of Ae. albopictus samples 
      collected over a four-year period (2007-2010) in São Paulo, Brazil. Wing size 
      significantly decreased during this period for both sexes and the wing shape also 
      changed over time, with the wing shapes of males showing greater differences after 
      2008 and those of females differing more after 2009. Given that the wings play 
      sex-specific roles, these findings suggest that the males and females could be 
      affected by differential evolutionary pressures. Consistent with this hypothesis, a 
      sexually dimorphic pattern was detected and quantified: the females were larger than 
      the males (with respect to the mean) and had a distinct wing shape, regardless of 
      allometric effects. In conclusion, wing alterations, particularly those involving 
      shape, are a sensitive indicator of microevolutionary processes in this species.

TI  - New infectious etiologies for posterior uveitis.
PG  - 66-72
LID - 10.1159/000344009 [doi]
AB  - Emergent and resurgent arthropod vector-borne diseases are major causes of systemic 
      morbidity and death and expanding worldwide. Among them, viral and bacterial agents 
      including West Nile virus, Dengue fever, Chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, and 
      rickettsioses have been recently associated with an array of ocular manifestations. 
      These include anterior uveitis, retinitis, chorioretinitis, retinal vasculitis and 
      optic nerve involvement. Proper clinical diagnosis of any of these infectious 
      diseases is based on epidemiological data, history, systemic symptoms and signs, and 
      the pattern of ocular involvement. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by the 
      detection of a specific antibody in serum. Ocular involvement associated with 
      emergent infections usually has a self-limited course, but it can result in 
      persistent visual impairment. There is currently no proven specific treatment for 
      arboviral diseases, and therapy is mostly supportive. Vaccination for humans against 
      these viruses is still in the research phase. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice 
      for rickettsial diseases. Prevention, including public measures to reduce the number 
      of mosquitoes and personal protection, remains the mainstay for arthropod vector 
      disease control. Influenza A (H1N1) virus was responsible for a pandemic human 
      influenza in 2009, and was recently associated with various posterior segment 
      changes.

AB  - We report the case of a 19-year-old surfer, returning from Central America, who 
      presented with chronic cough. The X-ray and full blood count, which had been 
      performed in Costa Rica, were without pathology; laboratory parameters showed 
      slightly increased C-reactive protein (59 mg/l). Malaria was excluded by thick 
      smear. Immune serological tests for typhus, paratyphus, brucellosis, rickettsioses, 
      leptospirosis and dengue fever were negative. An ambulant antimicrobial treatment 
      was without any clinical effect. A computer tomography of the thorax showed a solid 
      lesion (30 × 20 mm, middle lobe of the right lung). The patient rejected a 
      bronchoscopic examination. He decided to be treated after his return to Austria. 
      Here, we could substantiate a pulmonal histoplasmosis by a positive immune diffusion 
      test. The patient was successfully treated with itraconazole.

TI  - 67 kDa laminin receptor: structure, function and role in cancer and infection.
PG  - 8-12
AB  - The 67 kDa high affinity laminin receptor (67LR) is a non integrin cell surface 
      receptor for the extracellular matrix whose expression is increased in neoplastic 
      cells and directly correlates with an enhanced invasive and metastatic potential. 
      67LR derives from homo- or hetero-dimerization of a 37 kDa cytosolic precursor 
      (37LRP), by fatty acid acylation. Interestingly, 37LRP is a multifunctional protein 
      involved in the translational machinery and has also been found in the nucleus, 
      where it is tightly associated with nuclear structures. Acting as a receptor for 
      laminin is not the only function of this protein; indeed, 67LR also acts as a 
      receptor for viruses, such as Sindbis virus and Dengue virus, and is involved in the 
      internalization of the prion protein. Here, we review the current understanding of 
      the structure and function of this molecule, highlighting its role in cancer and 
      infection diseases.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae 
      family, a large family with 3 main genera (flavivirus, hepacivirus and pestivirus). 
      Among these viruses, there are several globally relevant human pathogens including 
      the mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese 
      encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV), as well as tick-borne viruses 
      such as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Since the mid-1990s, outbreaks of WN 
      fever and encephalitis have occurred throughout the world and WNV is now endemic in 
      Africa, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, Europe and the Unites States. This review 
      describes the molecular virology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and highlights recent 
      progress regarding diagnosis and vaccination against WNV infections.

TI  - Multiple blood meals in Anopheles darlingi (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 351-8

AB  - Anopheles darlingi is an important vector of human malaria in the Amazon. Adult 
      females of this mosquito species require a blood meal to develop eggs, preferring 
      humans to other blood sources. Although gonotrophic concordance has been described 
      as the norm for An. darlingi, here we report An. darlingi female mosquitoes taking 
      two or more blood meals within their first gonotrophic cycle. Only half of 
      field-captured adult females fed one blood meal developed follicles to Christophers' 
      stage V. This outcome is dependent on larval nutrition, as 88% of laboratory-raised 
      well-nourished females completed the first gonotrophic cycle with only one blood 
      meal, while less nourished females needed additional blood meals. Half of the 
      field-captured blood-seeking An. darlingi females had follicles in intermediate 
      (IIIa and IIIb) and final (V) stages of the gonotrophic cycle, supporting the 
      conclusion that An. darlingi blood feed more than once during a gonotrophic cycle. 
      Additionally, we observed females attempting to blood feed a second time during the 
      same day. Additional studies of An. darlingi biting behavior are necessary to 
      accurately estimate Plasmodium sp. entomologic inoculation rates throughout the An. 
      darlingi vast geographical distribution.

TI  - An interdisciplinary approach to controlling chikungunya outbreaks on French islands 
      in the south-west Indian ocean.
PG  - 66-71
AB  - The outbreak of chikungunya that occurred on French Island territories in the 
      southwest Indian Ocean in 2005 and 2006 caused severe morbidity and mortality. In 
      the aftermath, French authorities set up a scientific task force including experts 
      in epidemiology, public health, entomology, virology, immunology, sociology, animal 
      health, community and hospital medicine. The mission of the task force was to 
      conceive and propose research programs needed to increase understanding of the 
      disease and epidemic and to help public health officials in improving epidemic 
      response measures. The purpose of this article is to describe the findings of the 
      task force at the end of its two-year existence and initial outcomes in the the 
      areas studied. Discussion emphasizes topics requiring further study.

TI  - Murine Typhus: Clinical and epidemiological aspects.
PG  - 175-80
AB  - is an intracellular bacteria who causes murine typhus. His importance is reflected 
      in the high frequency founding specific antibodies against Rickettsia typhi in 
      several worldwide seroepidemiological studies, the seroprevalence ranging between 
      3-36%. Natural reservoirs of R. typhi are rats (some species belonging the Rattus 
      Genus) and fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) are his vector. This infection is associated 
      with overcrowding, pollution and poor hygiene. Typically presents fever, headache, 
      rash on trunk and extremities, in some cases may occur organ-specific complications, 
      affecting liver, kidney, lung or brain. Initially the disease is very similar to 
      other diseases, is very common to confuse the murine typhus with Dengue fever, 
      therefore, ignorance of the disease is a factor related to complications or 
      non-specific treatments for the resolution of this infection. This paper presents 
      the most relevant information to consider about the rickettsiosis caused by 
      Rickettsia typhi.

TI  - Viruses acquired abroad: what does the primary care physician need to know?
PG  - 681-91; quiz 692
LID - 10.3238/arztebl.2012.0681 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral infections are imported by travelers and immigrants from tropical 
      or subtropical regions. The primary care physician should be able to include these 
      diseases in the differential diagnosis of various clinical conditions. METHODS: This 
      review is based on pertinent articles retrieved by a selective search of the 
      literature, including guidelines from Germany and abroad. RESULTS: The available 
      data on imported viral infections in Germany constitute low-level evidence, because 
      most such infections are not reportable in this country. Useful data have, however, 
      been collected by international surveillance networks. Imported viral infections 
      usually present with fever, often also with a rash and elevated transaminases. An 
      average of 230 cases occur in Germany each year; the most common diagnosis among 
      them is dengue fever. An imported viral infection should also be included in the 
      differential diagnosis of fever with arthralgia, as chikungunya virus causes an 
      average of 38 such cases per year. On the other hand, in the past two years, there 
      have been only five cases of imported viral infections causing encephalitis (West 
      Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus). CONCLUSION: The primary care physician 
      should take a thorough history so that specifically targeted laboratory tests can be 
      ordered as soon as possible. If the suspicion of an imported viral infection is 
      confirmed, the patient should be transferred to a specialized treatment center.

TI  - Female-specific flightless (fsRIDL) phenotype for control of Aedes albopictus.
PG  - e1724
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001724 [doi]
LID - e1724
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is a vector of several 
      arboviruses including dengue and chikungunya, and is also a significant nuisance 
      mosquito. It is one of the most invasive of mosquitoes with a relentlessly 
      increasing geographic distribution. Conventional control methods have so far failed 
      to control Ae. albopictus adequately. Novel genetics-based strategies offer a 
      promising alternative or aid towards efficient control of this mosquito. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe here the isolation, characterisation and 
      use of the Ae. albopictus Actin-4 gene to drive a dominant lethal gene in the 
      indirect flight muscles of Ae. albopictus, thus inducing a conditional 
      female-specific late-acting flightless phenotype. We also show that in this context, 
      the Actin-4 regulatory regions from both Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti can be used 
      to provide conditional female-specific flightlessness in either species. 
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: With the disease-transmitting females incapacitated, the 
      female flightless phenotype encompasses a genetic sexing mechanism and would be 
      suitable for controlling Ae. albopictus using a male-only release approach as part 
      of an integrated pest management strategy.

TI  - Wolbachia in a major African crop pest increases susceptibility to viral disease 
      rather than protects.
PG  - 993-1000
LID - 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01820.x [doi]
AB  - Wolbachia are common vertically transmitted endosymbiotic bacteria found in < 70% of 
      insect species. They have generated considerable recent interest due to the capacity 
      of some strains to protect their insect hosts against viruses and the potential for 
      this to reduce vector competence of a range of human diseases, including dengue. In 
      contrast, here we provide data from field populations of a major crop pest, African 
      armyworm (Spodoptera exempta), which show that the prevalence and intensity of 
      infection with a nucleopolydrovirus (SpexNPV) is positively associated with 
      infection with three strains of Wolbachia. We also use laboratory bioassays to 
      demonstrate that infection with one of these strains, a male-killer, increases host 
      mortality due to SpexNPV by 6-14 times. These findings suggest that rather than 
      protecting their lepidopteran host from viral infection, Wolbachia instead make them 
      more susceptible. This finding potentially has implications for the biological 
      control of other insect crop pests.

TI  - Increase in larval gut proteolytic activities and Bti resistance in the Dengue fever 
      mosquito.
PG  - 71-83
LID - 10.1002/arch.21076 [doi]
AB  - The bioinsecticide Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) is increasingly 
      used worldwide for mosquito control. Although no established resistance to Bti has 
      been described in the field so far, a resistant Aedes aegypti strain (LiTOX strain) 
      was selected in the laboratory using field-collected leaf litter containing Bti 
      toxins. This selected strain exhibits a moderate resistance level to Bti, but a high 
      resistance level to individual Cry toxins. As Bti contains four different toxins, 
      generalist resistance mechanisms affecting mosquito tolerance to different toxins 
      were expected in the resistant strain. In the present work, we show that the 
      resistant strain exhibits an increase of various gut proteolytic activities 
      including trypsins, leucine-aminopeptidases, and carboxypeptidase A activities. 
      These elevated proteolytic activities resulted in a faster activation of Cry4Aa 
      protoxins while Cry4Ba or Cry11Aa were not affected. These results suggest that 
      changes in proteolytic activities may contribute to Bti resistance in mosquitoes 
      together with other mechanisms.

TI  - Synergistic effect of Eugenia jambolana Linn. and Solidago canadensis Linn. leaf 
      extracts with deltamethrin against the dengue vector Aedes aegypti Linn. at Mysore.

LID - 10.1007/s11356-012-1308-z [doi]
AB  - With the goal in mind to minimize the application of environmentally hazardous 
      chemical insecticides, the larvicidal activity of two plant extracts along with 
      deltamethrin was studied at University of Mysore. The extracts of Solidago 
      canadensis and Eugenia jambolana were employed for working out the synergistic 
      efficacy against Aedes aegypti larvae, as the extracts of both the plants exhibited 
      high efficacy when applied individually. The deltamethrin when analyzed separately, 
      LC50 and LC90 values were 0.00045 and 0.00148 ppm, respectively. Synergistic studies 
      with two plant extracts on deltamethrin revealed S. canadensis as more effective 
      with synergistic factor(SF) of 4.090 for LC50 value and 4.781 for LC90 followed by 
      E. jambolana with SF 1.80 for LC50 and 2.467 for LC90 at 1:1 ratio of the 
      phytoextracts and deltamethrin. Thus, S. canadensis was found to be a better 
      larvicidal and synergistic agent. Combination of phytochemical and insecticide were 
      found to be more effective than insecticides or phytochemicals alone which could be 
      a good ecofriendly and cost-effective approach to reduce the dose of chemicals with 
      high residual effect to be applied in vector control programs.

TI  - Dispersal of male Aedes aegypti in a coastal village in southern Mexico.
PG  - 665-76
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0513 [doi]
AB  - Most Aedes aegypti dispersal studies have focused on females because of their 
      central role in dengue virus transmission. Only a few mark-release-recapture (MRR) 
      studies provided insights into male Ae. aegypti dispersal. To fill this knowledge 
      gap, we conducted five male Ae. aegypti MRR experiments in a coastal village in 
      southern Mexico. Small and large male cohorts were marked with fluorescent dusts, 
      released outside buildings, and recaptures were carried out by using backpack 
      aspirators. Recapture rates ranged between 0.35% and 6.55% and median distance 
      traveled was 12-166 meters. A statistically significant difference in median 
      distance traveled with large males dispersing farther than small ones was detected 
      only in one experiment (MRR5: U = 3.5, P < 0.01). Male dispersal data will be useful 
      for constructing and estimating parameter values and validating models that will be 
      used to plan the most effective release strategies for genetically modified male Ae. 
      aegypti.

TI  - Identifying insecticide resistance genes in mosquito by combining AFLP genome scans 
      and 454 pyrosequencing.
PG  - 1672-86
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05499.x [doi]
AB  - AFLP-based genome scans are widely used to study the genetics of adaptation and to 
      identify genomic regions potentially under selection. However, this approach usually 
      fails to detect the actual genes or mutations targeted by selection owing to the 
      difficulties of obtaining DNA sequences from AFLP fragments. Here, we combine 
      classical AFLP outlier detection with 454 sequencing of AFLP fragments to obtain 
      sequences from outlier loci. We applied this approach to the study of resistance to 
      Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) toxins in the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. 
      A genome scan of Bti-resistant and Bti-susceptible A. aegypti laboratory strains was 
      performed based on 432 AFLP markers. Fourteen outliers were detected using two 
      different population genetic algorithms. Out of these, 11 were successfully 
      sequenced. Three contained transposable elements (TEs) sequences, and the 10 
      outliers that could be mapped at a unique location in the reference genome were 
      located on different supercontigs. One outlier was in the vicinity of a gene coding 
      for an aminopeptidase potentially involved in Bti toxin-binding. Patterns of 
      sequence variability of this gene showed significant deviation from neutrality in 
      the resistant strain but not in the susceptible strain, even after taking into 
      account the known demographic history of the selected strain. This gene is a 
      promising candidate for future functional analysis.

TI  - Travel and transplantation: travel-related diseases in transplant recipients.
PG  - 594-600
LID - 10.1097/MOT.0b013e328359266b [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Travel-related diseases may be seen in transplant recipients 
      after travel, after transplant tourism, and via transmission from blood and organ 
      donors, augmented by recent increases in travel, migration, and globalization. Such 
      infections include tuberculosis, Plasmodium (malaria), Babesia, Trypanosoma cruzi 
      (Chagas disease), Strongyloides, Coccidioides, Histoplasma, Leishmania, Brucella, 
      HTLV, dengue, among numerous others. RECENT FINDINGS: Review of cohorts of 
      transplant recipients show that they tend to have minimal or suboptimal preparation 
      prior to travel, with limited pretravel vaccination, medications, and education, 
      which poses a greatly increased risk of travel-related infections and complications. 
      The epidemiology of such travel-related infections in transplant recipients, along 
      with methods for prevention, including vaccines, chemoprophylaxis, and education may 
      help SOT recipients avoid travel-related infections, and are discussed in this 
      review. SUMMARY: Optimizing the understanding of the risk of tropical, 
      geographically restricted, and other unusual or unexpected, travel-related 
      infections will enhance the safety of vulnerable transplant recipients from 
      potentially life-threatening infections.

AB  - Outbreaks of flaviviruses such as dengue (DV), yellow fever (YFV), Japanese 
      encephalitis (JEV), tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) and West Nile (WNV) affect 
      numerous countries around the world. The fast spread of these viruses is the result 
      of increases in the human population, rapid urbanisation and globalisation. While 
      vector control is an important preventive measure against vector-borne diseases, it 
      has failed to prevent the spread of these diseases, particularly in developing 
      countries where the implementation of control measures is intermittent. As antiviral 
      drugs against flaviviruses are not yet available, vaccination remains the most 
      important tool for prevention. Although human vaccines for YFV, TBEV and JEV are 
      available, on-going vaccination efforts are insufficient to prevent infection. No 
      vaccines against DENV and WNV are available. Research advances have provided 
      important tools for flavivirus vaccine development, such as the use of plants as a 
      recombinant antigen production platform. This review summarises the research efforts 
      in this area and highlights why a plant system is considered a necessary alternative 
      production platform for high-tech subunit vaccines.

TI  - Do viral infections mimic bacterial sepsis? The role of microvascular permeability: 
      A review of mechanisms and methods.
PG  - 2-15
LID - 10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.10.019 [doi]
AB  - A dysregulated immune response and functional immunosuppression have been considered 
      the major mechanisms of the bacterial sepsis syndrome. More recently, the loss of 
      endothelial barrier function and resultant microvascular leak have been found to be 
      a key determinant of the pathogenesis of bacterial sepsis. Whether a similar 
      paradigm applies to systemic viral syndromes is not known. Answering this question 
      has far-reaching implications for the development of future anti-viral therapeutic 
      strategies. In this review, we provide an overview of the structure and function of 
      the endothelium and how its barrier integrity is compromised in bacterial sepsis. 
      The various in vitro and in vivo methodologies available to investigate vascular 
      leak are reviewed. Emphasis is placed on the advantages and limitations of cell 
      culture techniques, which represent the most commonly used methods. Within this 
      context, we appraise recent studies of three viruses - hantavirus, human herpes 
      virus 8 and dengue virus - that suggest microvascular leak may play a role in the 
      pathogenesis of these viral infections. We conclude with a discussion of how 
      endothelial barrier breakdown may occur in other viral infections such as H5N1 avian 
      influenza virus.

LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-56 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past ten years, the Indian Ocean region has been the theatre of 
      severe epidemics of chikungunya and dengue. These outbreaks coincided with a high 
      increase in populations of Aedes albopictus that outcompete its sister taxon Aedes 
      aegypti in most islands sampled. The objective of this work was to update the 
      entomological survey of the two Aedes species in the island of Madagascar which has 
      to face these arboviroses. METHODS: The sampling of Aedes mosquitoes was conducted 
      during two years, from October 2007 to October 2009, in fifteen localities from 
      eight regions of contrasting climates. Captured adults were identified immediately 
      whereas immature stages were bred until adult stage for determination. Phylogenetic 
      analysis was performed using two mtDNA genes, COI and ND5 and trees were constructed 
      by the maximum likelihood (ML) method with the gene time reversible (GTR) model. 
      Experimental infections with the chikungunya virus strain 06.21 at a titer of 107.5 
      pfu/mL were performed to evaluate the vector competence of field-collected 
      mosquitoes. Disseminated infection rates were measured fourteen days after infection 
      by immunofluorescence assay performed on head squashes. RESULTS: The species Aedes 
      aegypti was detected in only six sites in native forests and natural reserves. In 
      contrast, the species Aedes albopictus was found in 13 out of the 15 sites sampled. 
      Breeding sites were mostly found in man-made environments such as discarded 
      containers, used tires, abandoned buckets, coconuts, and bamboo cuts. Linear 
      regression models showed that the abundance of Ae. albopictus was significantly 
      influenced by the sampling region (F = 62.00, p < 2.2 × 10(-16)) and period (F = 
      36.22, p = 2.548 × 10(-13)), that are associated with ecological and climate 
      variations. Phylogenetic analysis of the invasive Ae. albopictus distinguished 
      haplotypes from South Asia and South America from those of Madagascar, but the 
      markers used were not discriminant enough to discern Malagasy populations. The 
      experimental oral infection method showed that six Ae. albopictus populations 
      exhibited high dissemination infection rates for chikungunya virus ranging from 98 
      to 100%. CONCLUSION: In Madagascar, Ae. albopictus has extended its geographical 
      distribution whereas, Ae. aegypti has become rare, contrasting with what was 
      previously observed. Changes are predominantly driven by human activities and the 
      rainfall regime that provide suitable breeding sites for the highly anthropophilic 
      mosquito Ae. albopictus. Moreover, these populations were found to be highly 
      susceptible to chikungunya virus. In the light of this study, Ae. albopictus may 
      have been involved in the recent outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue epidemics in 
      Madagascar, and consequently, control measures should be promoted to limit its 
      current expansion.

TI  - Carbosilane glycodendrimers.
PG  - 4574-98
LID - 10.1039/c2cs35421g [doi]
AB  - Glycodendrimers fascinate both carbohydrate chemists and biologists because of their 
      ability to recognize lectins and enhance carbohydrate-protein interactions. These 
      characteristics make glycodendrimers a valuable tool in glycoscience and chemical 
      biology. Many glycodendrimers have been described to date; this tutorial review 
      focuses specifically on carbosilane glycodendrimers. We present methodologies for 
      synthesizing parent carbosilane dendrimers and describe their use in biological 
      assays. We also describe representative functionalizations of parent carbosilane 
      dendrimers at terminal positions which are necessary for chemical ligation with 
      carbohydrate ligands. This is followed by a description of all coupling reactions 
      between carbohydrate and carbosilane dendrimer functionalities used in the synthesis 
      of carbosilane glycodendrimers. The major emphasis of this review is the use of 
      carbosilane glycodendrimers as medical agents against Shiga toxins, dengue viruses, 
      relapsing fever Borrelia, and hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of influenza viruses, 
      as well as on the relationship between dendrimer structure and these biological 
      activities. The last two sections introduce recent attempts to use carbosilane 
      glycodendrimers as new versatile and widely-applicable lectin sensors, and the use 
      of carbosilane glycodendrimers as a novel drug carrier in an active targeting drug 
      delivery system. This review article will be of interest to scientists in the areas 
      of organic chemistry, chemical biology, carbohydrate chemistry, heteroatom 
      chemistry, and organosilicon chemistry.

TI  - Insecticide susceptibility of Aedes aegypti populations from Senegal and Cape Verde 
      Archipelago.
PG  - 238
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-238 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two concomitant dengue 3 (DEN-3) epidemics occurred in Cape Verde 
      Archipelago and Senegal between September and October 2009. Aedes aegypti was 
      identified as the vector of these epidemics as several DEN-3 virus strains were 
      isolated from this species in both countries. The susceptibility to pyrethroids, 
      organochlorine, organophosphates and carbamate was investigated in two field strains 
      of Aedes aegypti from both countries using WHO diagnostic bioassay kits in order to 
      monitor their the current status of insecticide susceptibility. FINDINGS: The two 
      tested strains were highly resistant to DDT. The Cape Verde strain was found to be 
      susceptible to all others tested insecticides except for propoxur 0.1%, which needs 
      further investigation. The Dakar strain was susceptible to fenitrothion 1% and 
      permethrin 0.75%, but displayed reduced susceptibility to deltamethrin, 
      lambda-cyhalothrin and propoxur. CONCLUSIONS: As base-line results, our observations 
      stress a careful management of insecticide use for the control of Ae. aegypti. 
      Indeed, they indicate that DDT is no longer efficient for the control of Ae. aegypti 
      populations in Cape Verde and Dakar and further suggest a thorough follow-up of 
      propoxur susceptibility status in both sites and that of deltamethrin and 
      lambda-cyhalothrin in Ae. aegypti populations in Dakar. Thus, regular monitoring of 
      susceptibility is greatly needed as well as the knowing if this observed 
      resistance/susceptibility is focal or not and for observed resistance, the use of 
      biochemical methods is needed with detailed comparison of resistance levels over a 
      large geographic area. KEYWORDS: Aedes aegypti, Insecticides, Susceptibility, Cape 
      Verde, Senegal.

TI  - Suitability of European climate for the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus: 
      recent trends and future scenarios.
PG  - 2708-17
LID - 10.1098/rsif.2012.0138 [doi]
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is an invasive species that has the 
      potential to transmit infectious diseases such as dengue and chikungunya fever. 
      Using high-resolution observations and regional climate model scenarios for the 
      future, we investigated the suitability of Europe for A. albopictus using both 
      recent climate and future climate conditions. The results show that southern France, 
      northern Italy, the northern coast of Spain, the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea 
      and western Turkey were climatically suitable areas for the establishment of the 
      mosquito during the 1960-1980s. Over the last two decades, climate conditions have 
      become more suitable for the mosquito over central northwestern Europe (Benelux, 
      western Germany) and the Balkans, while they have become less suitable over southern 
      Spain. Similar trends are likely in the future, with an increased risk simulated 
      over northern Europe and slightly decreased risk over southern Europe. These 
      distribution shifts are related to wetter and warmer conditions favouring the 
      overwintering of A. albopictus in the north, and drier and warmer summers that might 
      limit its southward expansion.

      and Central America, is usually transferred via a mosquito vector. The human botfly 
      should be considered in patients who have traveled to these endemic regions and 
      present with a mosquito bite history and non-healing skin lesions. OBJECTIVES: We 
      present this case to increase awareness among emergency physicians regarding 
      furuncular myiasis from the human botfly. CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old pregnant woman 
      presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with an intensely pruritic lesion to the 
      right calf and mild systemic symptoms 6 weeks after travel to Belize. The lesion she 
      thought was a mosquito bite had persisted despite escalating treatment modalities 
      and had been incorrectly diagnosed by multiple physicians. CONCLUSION: Parasitic 
      disease is not always a systemic process. Botfly infestation presents as local 
      boil-like lesions that are irritating and uncomfortable. Once correctly identified, 
      it can be easily treated in the ED.

AB  - Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) impair the lives of 1 billion people worldwide, 
      and threaten the health of millions more. Although vaccine candidates have been 
      proposed to prevent some NTDs, no vaccine is available at the market yet. Vaccines 
      against NTDs should be low-cost and needle-free to reduce the logistic cost of their 
      administration. Plant-based vaccines meet both requirements: plant systems allow 
      antigen production at low cost, and also yield an optimal delivery vehicle that 
      prevents or delays digestive hydrolysis of vaccine antigens. This review covers 
      recent reports on the development of plant-based vaccines against NTDs. Efforts 
      conducted by a number of research groups to develop vaccines as a mean to fight 
      rabies, cysticercosis, dengue, and helminthiasis are emphasized. Future perspectives 
      are identified, such as the need to develop vaccination models for more than ten 
      pathologies through a plant-based biotechnological approach. Current limitations on 
      the method are also noted, and molecular approaches that might allow us to address 
      such limitations are discussed.

TI  - Aedes albopictus in Lebanon, a potential risk of arboviruses outbreak.
PG  - 300
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-12-300 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mosquito Aedes albopictus is undergoing a worldwide expansion with 
      potential consequences on transmission of various arboviruses. This species has been 
      first detected in Lebanon in 2003. METHODS: We performed a phylogenetic study of 
      Lebanese specimens and assessed their host preference by detecting human, cat, dog 
      and chicken immunoglobulins in mosquito blood-meals. Their capacity to transmit 
      arboviruses was investigated by providing infectious blood-meals using an artificial 
      feeding system followed by detection of viral particles in mosquito saliva. RESULTS: 
      Our results suggest that Lebanese strains are part of the recent wave of Ae. 
      albopictus expansion and are related to some European, African and North American 
      strains. They exhibited a host preference towards humans and an important capacity 
      to transmit arboviruses. Indeed, we showed that Ae. albopictus was able to transmit 
      chikungunya (CHIKV), dengue (DENV) and West-Nile (WNV) viruses. At day 10 after an 
      infectious blood-meal at a titer of 108 MID50/ml, 30% of mosquitoes delivered an 
      average of 515 ± 781 viral particles of CHIKV in saliva collected using a forced 
      salivation technique and 55% with an average of 245 ± 304 viral particles when 
      infected with WNV. Whereas DENV was not found in saliva at day 10 post-infection 
      (pi), an average of 174 ± 455 viral particles was detected in 38.1% of mosquitoes 
      tested at day 21 after an infectious blood-meal at a higher titer of 109 MID50/ml. 
      CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that Ae. albopictus around Beirut is a 
      potential vector of the three tested arboviruses.

TI  - Fitness evaluation of two Brazilian Aedes aegypti field populations with distinct 
      levels of resistance to the organophosphate temephos.
PG  - 916-22
LID - S0074-02762012000700013 [pii]
AB  - In Brazil, decades of dengue vector control using organophosphates and pyrethroids 
      have led to dissemination of resistance. Although these insecticides have been 
      employed for decades against Aedes aegypti in the country, knowledge of the impact 
      of temephos resistance on vector viability is limited. We evaluated several fitness 
      parameters in two Brazilian Ae. aegypti populations, both classified as deltamethrin 
      resistant but with distinct resistant ratios (RR) for temephos. The 
      insecticide-susceptible Rockefeller strain was used as an experimental control. The 
      population presenting the higher temephos resistance level, Aparecida de Goiânia, 
      state of Goiás (RR(95) of 19.2), exhibited deficiency in the following four 
      parameters: blood meal acceptance, amount of ingested blood, number of eggs and 
      frequency of inseminated females. Mosquitoes from Boa Vista, state of Roraima, the 
      population with lower temephos resistance level (RR(95) of 7.4), presented 
      impairment in only two parameters, blood meal acceptance and frequency of 
      inseminated females. These results indicate that the overall fitness handicap was 
      proportional to temephos resistance levels. However, it is unlikely that these 
      disabilities can be attributed solely to temephos resistance, since both populations 
      are also resistant to deltamethrin and harbour the kdr allele, which indicates 
      resistance to pyrethroids. The effects of reduced fitness in resistant populations 
      are discussed.

TI  - Impacts of Wolbachia infection on predator prey relationships: evaluating survival 
      and horizontal transfer between wMelPop infected Aedes aegypti and its predators.
PG  - 624-30
AB  - The wMelPop strain of Wolbachia is currently being investigated for its potential 
      use as a biological control agent to reduce the ability of Aedes aegypti (L.) 
      mosquitoes to transmit dengue viruses. The survival of a potential wMelPop infected 
      Ae. aegypti strain for field release is important as a higher susceptibility to 
      predation in the wMelPop strain could result in difficulties in achieving fixation. 
      We investigated immature and adult survival as a function of susceptibility to 
      predation by six naturally occurring predator species; cyclopoid copepods, fish, 
      predatory Toxorhynchites mosquito larvae and a salticid jumping spider. The trials 
      indicated that wMelPop infected and uninfected Ae. aegypti larvae and adults were 
      equally susceptible to predation to all six tested predators. In addition to 
      evaluating any potential fitness costs to the infected host, we were unable to 
      demonstrate horizontal transfer of wMelPop via consumption of infected Ae. aegypti 
      larvae to the above predators. That susceptibility to predation was consistent 
      across mosquito life stage, predator species and experimental venue is strong 
      evidence that despite the neurotrophic and extensive nature of wMelPop infection, 
      behavioral changes are not occurring, or at least not a determining factor in 
      survival when exposed to a predator. Based on our results and the ecology of 
      Wolbachia and mosquito predators, horizontal transfer of wMelPop from Ae. aegypti 
      into naturally occurring predators is not cause for concern.

PG  - 411-37
LID - 10.1146/annurev-cellbio-092910-153958 [doi]
AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are neutral lipid storage organelles ubiquitous to eukaryotic 
      cells. It is increasingly recognized that LDs interact extensively with other 
      organelles and that they perform functions beyond passive lipid storage and lipid 
      homeostasis. One emerging function for LDs is the coordination of immune responses, 
      as these organelles participate in the generation of prostaglandins and 
      leukotrienes, which are important inflammation mediators. Similarly, LDs are also 
      beginning to be recognized as playing a role in interferon responses and in antigen 
      cross presentation. Not surprisingly, there is emerging evidence that many 
      pathogens, including hepatitis C and Dengue viruses, Chlamydia, and Mycobacterium, 
      target LDs during infection either for nutritional purposes or as part of an 
      anti-immunity strategy. We here review recent findings that link LDs to the 
      regulation and execution of immune responses in the context of host-pathogen 
      interactions.

AB  - Larvicidal activity of 12 fractions and a compound of chloroform extract of 
      Clerodendrum phlomidis L. (Lamiaceae) was assayed for their toxicity against the 
      early fourth-instar larvae of the filarial vector Culex quinquefasciatus Say and 
      dengue vector Aedes aegypti L. The fractions were tested at 100-, 50-, 25- and 
      12.5-ppm concentrations. The compound pectolinaringenin was tested at 5-, 2.5-, 1.0- 
      and 0.5-ppm concentrations. Among the different fractions, fraction 5 recorded the 
      lowest LC(50) and LC(90) values of 5.02, 61.63 ppm and 32.86, 73.62 ppm against C. 
      quinquefasciatus and A. aegypti, respectively. The compound pectolinaringenin showed 
      the lowest LC(50) and LC(90) values of 0.62, 2.87 ppm and 0.79, 5.31 ppm against C. 
      quinquefasciatus and A. aegypti, respectively. This is the first report on the 
      mosquito larvicidal activity of the isolated compound pectolinaringenin from C. 
      phlomidis. The results of this study show that the chloroform extract of C. 
      phlomidis can be used as a potent source and pectolinaringenin as a new natural 
      mosquito larvicidal agent.

AB  - All diseases diagnosed in a primary healthcare clinic situated in Leogane, Haiti, 
      were recorded prospectively during a 7-month period. Among the patients in this 
      cohort, 2,821 of 6,631 (42.6%) presented with an infectious disease. The three most 
      common syndromes among the patients presenting with infections were respiratory 
      tract infections (33.5%), suspected sexually transmitted diseases--mostly among 
      females with recurrent disease (18.1%)--and skin and soft tissue infections, 
      including multiple cases of tinea capitis (12.8%). Of the 255 patients presenting 
      with undifferentiated fever, 76 (29.8%) were diagnosed with falciparum malaria. 
      Other vector-borne diseases included 13 cases of filariasis and 6 cases of dengue 
      fever. Human immunodeficiency virus infection was diagnosed in 19 patients. Four 
      cases of mumps were detected among unimmunized children. A large proportion of these 
      infections are preventable. Concerted efforts should be made to create large-scale 
      preventive medicine programs for various infectious diseases.

AB  - The development of technologies with rapid and sensitive detection capabilities and 
      increased throughput have become crucial for responding to greater number of threats 
      posed by emerging and re-emerging viruses in the recent past. The conventional 
      identification methods require time-consuming culturing, and/or detection of 
      antibodies, which are not very sensitive and specific. The recent advances in 
      molecular biology techniques in the field of genomics and proteomics greatly 
      facilitate the rapid identification with more accuracy. The real-time assays viz; 
      SYBR green I based real time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP have been developed for rapid 
      detection as well as typing of some of the emerging arboviruses of biomedical 
      importance viz; Dengue, Japanese Encephalitis, Chikungunya, West Nile, SARS and 
      Swine Flu etc. Both these techniques are capable of detection and differentiation as 
      well as quantifying viral load with higher sensitivity, rapidity and specificity. 
      One of the most important advantages of RT-LAMP is its field applicability, without 
      requirement of any sophisticated equipments. The establishment of these real time 
      molecular assays will certainly facilitate the rapid detection of viruses with high 
      degree of precision and accuracy in future.

PG  - 842-50

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) data from population studies are sparse. During the 2006 
      epidemic, 509 clinical cases (43% attack rate) were identified in a village survey 
      (West India); laboratory investigations demonstrated normal blood cell counts, 
      elevated acute-phase reactants [erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein 
      and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] and excluded malaria and dengue. Acute CHIKV was 
      characterized by high fever, severe peripheral polyarthralgias, axial myalgias and 
      intense fatigue in over 90% of cases; skin rash (34%) and headache (19%) were 
      uncommon. There were 49% and 62% of survey cases seropositive for IgM (rapid assay) 
      and IgG (immunofluorescence) anti-CHIKV antibodies, respectively. Sixty-five percent 
      of cases recovered within 4 weeks. None of the cases died. Of the population, 4·1% 
      and 1·6% suffered from persistent rheumatic pains, predominantly non-specific, at 1 
      and 2 years, respectively. Chronic inflammatory arthritis was uncommon (0·3% at 1 
      year) although serum IL-6 often remained elevated in chronic cases. A larger 
      population study is required to describe post-CHIKV rheumatism and its prognosis.

TI  - Droplet size and efficacy of an adulticide-larvicide ultralow-volume formulation on 
      Aedes aegypti using different solvents and spray application methods.
PG  - 137-41
LID - 10.1002/ps.2237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: When cases of dengue are reported or the density of adult Aedes aegypti 
      (L.) becomes too high, ultralow-volume (ULV) application of insecticides is the 
      recommended control method. The droplet size of an aerosol insecticide influences 
      its efficiency in killing adult mosquitoes. Many studies have been carried out to 
      determine the optimum droplet size that maximises vector control efforts, but only a 
      few have determined droplet-size spectra for specific equipment using different 
      solvents and comparing thermal and non-thermal aerosols. RESULTS: The present study 
      showed that the droplet size for a water-based adulticide-larvicide formulation was 
      larger than for the same formulation diluted in gasoil or biodiesel. No significant 
      differences in adult mortality were observed between sprayers and solvents, but 
      efficacy decreased with distance from the sprayer nozzle. Adult emergence inhibition 
      was more than 90% when using water as a solvent for both thermal and cold foggers, 
      and the efficacy did not decrease with distance from the sprayer nozzle. On the 
      other hand, oil-based solvents became less effective with distance. CONCLUSION: The 
      use of water as a solvent with both thermal and cold foggers improves the efficacy 
      of the studied formulation containing permethrin as adulticide and pyriproxyfen as 
      larvicide in scaled-up assays. Moreover, it reduces the environmental impact and 
      costs of spraying by comparison with formulations using oil solvents.

TI  - Threats from emerging and re-emerging neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).
LID - 10.3402/iee.v2i0.18667 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neglected tropical diseases impact over 1 billion of the world's poorest 
      populations and require special attention. However, within the NTDs recognized by 
      the World Health Organization, some are also dually categorized as emerging and 
      re-emerging infectious diseases requiring more detailed examination on potential 
      global health risks. METHODS: We reviewed the 17 NTDs classified by the WHO to 
      determine if those NTDs were also categorized by the US Centers for Disease Control 
      and Prevention as emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (''EReNTDs''). We 
      then identified common characteristics and risks associated with EReNTDs. RESULTS: 
      Identified EReNTDs of dengue, rabies, Chagas Disease, and cysticercosis 
      disproportionately impact resource-poor settings with poor social determinants of 
      health, spread through globalization, are impacted by vector control, lack available 
      treatments, and threaten global health security. This traditionally neglected subset 
      of diseases requires urgent attention and unique incentive structures to encourage 
      investment in innovation and coordination. DISCUSSION: Multi-sectorial efforts and 
      targeted public-private partnerships would spur needed R&D for effective and 
      accessible EReNTD treatments, improvement of social determinants of health, crucial 
      low-income country development, and health system strengthening efforts. Utilization 
      of One Health principles is essential for enhancing knowledge to efficaciously 
      address public health aspects of these EReNTDs globally.

PG  - 799-804

AB  - West Nile Virus (WNV) protease is a two-component protease, important for the 
      maturation of virus by cleaving the viral ploypeptide into functional proteins. WNV 
      protease contains a Nonstructural (NS) protein 3 possessing the protease active 
      sites and is regulated by a cofactor region containing approximately 40 amino acids 
      from an integral membrane protein, NS2B. Although NS2B was demonstrated to be 
      important for the location of the protease on the membrane, there was no direct 
      evidence to show the interaction between protease (NS3) and membrane. Herein, we 
      investigated the interaction between WNV protease and dodecylphosphocoline (DPC) 
      micelles using NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that amino acids (31-33) from 
      NS3 were important for the interaction with detergent micelles, which was similar to 
      the finding in the study of protease from Dengue virus. This region may serve as an 
      anchoring site to stabilized NS3 protease domain on the membrane.

      conditionally lethal transgene have recently been used to suppress local vector 
      populations in small-scale field releases. Prior to releases of transgenic insects 
      on a wider scale, however, most regulatory authorities will require additional 
      evidence that suppression will be effective in natural heterogeneous habitats. We 
      use a spatially explicit stochastic model of an Ae. aegypti population in Iquitos, 
      Peru, along with an uncertainty analysis of its predictions, to quantitatively 
      assess the outcome of varied operational approaches for releases of transgenic 
      strains with conditional death of females. We show that population elimination might 
      be an unrealistic objective in heterogeneous populations. We demonstrate that 
      substantial suppression can nonetheless be achieved if releases are deployed in a 
      uniform spatial pattern using strains combining multiple lethal elements, 
      illustrating the importance of detailed spatial models for guiding genetic mosquito 
      control strategies.

TI  - Effects of irradiation, presence of females, and sugar supply on the longevity of 
      sterile males Aedes albopictus (Skuse) under semi-field conditions on Reunion 
      Island.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of the sterile insect technique (SIT) for reducing 
      populations of Aedes albopictus (Skuse), (the vector of Chikungunya and Dengue 
      fever), was studied in Reunion Island. For some mosquito species the sterilization 
      process and mating activity may alter male survival. Most previous studies were 
      carried out in the laboratory and may inadequately reflect the field situation. We 
      conducted a semi-field experiment to evaluate the impact of sugar supply and mating 
      activity under natural climatic conditions on wild and sterile male Ae. albopictus 
      longevity, using large cages set up in an open clearing between trees and shrubs in 
      Reunion Island. RESULTS: Wild males had a mean longevity of 15.5 days in the absence 
      of females and with an immediate sugar supply; longevity in sterile males was 
      similar. The presence of females greatly reduced both wild and especially sterile 
      male lifespan; however, an immediate sugar supply could counteract this effect and 
      allow sterile males to live an average of 11.6 days. CONCLUSION: The outcomes 
      indicate that sugar feeding could compensate for sterilization-induced damage, and 
      that mating activity is not deleterious for well-fed males. This study stresses the 
      critical importance of providing suitable sugar sources prior to release during SIT 
      programmes.

AB  - It is currently unclear what role microhabitat land cover plays in determining the 
      seasonal spatial distribution of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, disease 
      vectors of dengue and West Nile Virus, respectively, in Tucson, AZ. We compared 
      mosquito abundance to sixteen land cover variables derived from 2010 NAIP 
      multispectral data and 2008 LiDAR height data. Mosquitoes were trapped with 30-9 
      traps from May to October of 2010 and 2011. Variables were extracted for five buffer 
      zones (10-50 m radii at 10 m intervals) around trapping sites. Stepwise regression 
      was performed to determine the best scale for observation and the influential land 
      cover variables. The 30 m radius buffer was determined to be the best for observing 
      the land cover-mosquito abundance relationship. Ae. aegypti presence was positively 
      associated with structure and medium height trees and negatively associated with 
      bare earth; Cx. quinquefasciatus presence was positively associated with pavement 
      and medium height trees and negatively associated with shrubs. These findings 
      emphasize vegetation, impervious surfaces, and soil influences on mosquito presence 
      in an urban setting. Lastly, the land cover-mosquito abundance relationships were 
      used to produce risk maps of seasonal presence that highlight high risk areas in 
      Tucson, which may be useful for focusing mosquito control program actions.

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit dreadful diseases to human beings wherein biological control of 
      these vectors using plant-derived molecules would be an alternative to reduce 
      mosquito population. Aqueous leaf extract and green synthesized silver nanoparticles 
      (Ag NPs) from Pedilanthus tithymaloides (L.) Poit. were investigated for their 
      efficacy against the dengue vector Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera; Culicidae). The 
      biologically synthesized Ag NPs were characterized by UV-vis spectrum, X-ray 
      diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and surface characteristics by atomic force 
      microscopy. Further, on exposure of the larvae to varying concentrations of aqueous 
      leaf and Ag NPs for 24 h, these Ag NPs showed 100 % mortality from first to fourth 
      instars and pupae of A. aegypti at 0.25 %, which is the highest concentration, 
      tested, wherein it was the lowest concentration of aqueous leaf extract alone which 
      showed only 10-18 % of mortality. Lethal concentration (LC(50)) values of Ag NPs 
      against the larval and pupal stages were 0.029, 0.027, 0.047, 0.086, and 0.018 % 
      with no mortality in control. These results suggest that the use of P. tithymaloides 
      silver nanoparticles can be a rapid, environmentally safer bio-pesticide which can 
      form a novel approach to develop effective biocides for controlling the target 
      vector.

TI  - The role of male harassment on female fitness for the dengue vector mosquito Aedes 
      aegypti.
PG  - 1131-1140
AB  - Sexual harassment studies in insects suggest that females can incur several kinds of 
      costs from male harassment and mating. Here, we examined direct and indirect costs 
      of male harassment on components of female fitness in the predominantly monandrous 
      mosquito Aedes aegypti. To disentangle the costs of harassment versus the costs of 
      mating, we held females at a low or high density with males whose claspers were 
      modified to prevent insemination, and compared these to females held with normal 
      males and to those held with females or alone. A reduced longevity was observed when 
      females were held under high density conditions with males or females, regardless if 
      male claspers had been modified. There was no consistent effect of harassment on 
      female fecundity. Net reproductive rate (R(0)) was higher in females held at low 
      density with normal males compared to females held with males in the other 
      treatments, even though only a small number of females showed direct evidence of 
      remating. Indirect costs and benefits that were not due to harassment alone were 
      observed. Daughters of females held with normal males at high density had reduced 
      longevity compared to daughters from females held without conspecifics. However, 
      their fitness (R(0)) was higher compared to females in all other treatments. 
      Overall, our results indicate that A. aegypti females do not suffer a fitness cost 
      from harassment of males when kept at moderate densities, and they suggest the 
      potential for benefits obtained from ejaculate components.

TI  - Cricket World Cup: a stress test for the surveillance system in the Caribbean.
PG  - 84-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the development and implementation of and major findings and 
      recommendations from, a regional mass gathering surveillance system (MGSS) in 
      support of the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup West Indies 2007. 
      METHODS: The regional MGSS was developed by the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre 
      (CAREC) and its member countries as an adaptation of the routine communicable 
      disease surveillance system in order to rapidly detect unusual disease events during 
      the tournament. The implementation of the MGSS required the identification of 
      additional human and financial resources, capacity building activities, laboratory 
      strengthening, and improved global epidemic surveillance and communication 
      mechanisms. RESULTS: Timeliness and completeness of data reporting in the MGSS were 
      both > 85%. No unusual pathogens were identified in the region during the 
      tournament. Only dengue and influenza, both endemic to the region, were identified. 
      The early alert aetection software used identified a total of 24 aberrations from 
      seven countries, the largest proportions being gastroenteritis, fever and 
      respiratory symptoms and injuries. All aberrations were promptly investigated and 
      most were found to be false alerts. Three unusual disease events were detected, all 
      from one country. They were responded to in a timely manner and did not adversely 
      affect the tournament. CONCLUSIONS: The surveillance capacities gained in preparing 
      for and supporting, the tournament assisted in strengthening and testing the already 
      existing national and regional communicable disease surveillance systems. Events 
      such as these should be utilized to strengthen already existing surveillance 
      systems, which should be flexible enough to respond to changing events.

TI  - [New vector control measures implemented between 2005 and 2011 on Reunion Island: 
      lessons learned from chikungunya epidemic].
PG  - 43-6
AB  - A major chikungunya outbreak concerned 38% of people living in Reunion Island in 
      2005-2006. Chikungunya is an arthropod-born-virus disease conveyed by mosquitoes 
      called Aedes albopictus. The health agency in Indian Ocean is responsible for vector 
      control. Previously, in the early 40s, vector control concerned only malaria 
      prophylaxis in La Réunion. Then, during the chikungunya outbreak, a new vector 
      control team was installed and learned from this epidemic. The lessons drawn from 
      chikungunya outbreak in La Réunion are about global executive management and 
      organization linked the local partners and population. The lessons also concern 
      technical topics such as the need of scientific research about vectors and 
      vector-control methods. Finally, the regional cooperation in Indian Ocean (Réunion, 
      Maurice, Seychelles, Comoros, Madagascar) has to be developed to share epidemiologic 
      and entomologic data in order to prevent new chikungunya or dengue outbreak.

      2011.
LID - 20172 [pii]
AB  - We describe the geographical and temporal distribution of West Nile neuroinvasive 
      diseases (WNND) cases in Italy from 2008 to 2011. The increasing number of confirmed 
      human cases from eight in 2008 to 18 in 2009 and the occurrence of the virus in a 
      larger geographical area in 2009 (moving from east to west) prompted the Ministry of 
      Health to publish, in spring 2010, a national programme for WNND human surveillance, 
      comprising veterinary and vector surveillance. Subsequently, in 2011, a new national 
      plan on integrated human surveillance of imported and autochthonous vector-borne 
      diseases (chikungunya, dengue and West Nile disease) was issued. Between 2008 and 
      2011, 43 cases of WNND were reported from five regions in Italy with a case fatality 
      rate of 16%. The incidence of WNND during the entire study period was 0.55 per 
      100,000 population (range: 0.06–0.23 per 100,000). During 2011, two new regions 
      (Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Sardinia) reported confirmed cases in humans. Integrated 
      human, entomological and animal surveillance for West Nile virus is a public health 
      priority in Italy and will be maintained during 2012.

TI  - Structure of hepatitis C virus polymerase in complex with primer-template RNA.
PG  - 6503-11
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00386-12 [doi]
AB  - The replication of the hepatitis C viral (HCV) genome is accomplished by the NS5B 
      RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), for which mechanistic understanding and 
      structure-guided drug design efforts have been hampered by its propensity to 
      crystallize in a closed, polymerization-incompetent state. The removal of an 
      autoinhibitory β-hairpin loop from genotype 2a HCV NS5B increases de novo RNA 
      synthesis by >100-fold, promotes RNA binding, and facilitated the determination of 
      the first crystallographic structures of HCV polymerase in complex with RNA 
      primer-template pairs. These crystal structures demonstrate the structural 
      realignment required for primer-template recognition and elongation, provide new 
      insights into HCV RNA synthesis at the molecular level, and may prove useful in the 
      structure-based design of novel antiviral compounds. Additionally, our approach for 
      obtaining the RNA primer-template-bound structure of HCV polymerase may be generally 
      applicable to solving RNA-bound complexes for other viral RdRps that contain similar 
      regulatory β-hairpin loops, including bovine viral diarrhea virus, dengue virus, and 
      West Nile virus.

TI  - Neglected tropical diseases of the Middle East and North Africa: review of their 
      prevalence, distribution, and opportunities for control.

AB  - The neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are highly endemic but patchily distributed 
      among the 20 countries and almost 400 million people of the Middle East and North 
      Africa (MENA) region, and disproportionately affect an estimated 65 million people 
      living on less than US$2 per day. Egypt has the largest number of people living in 
      poverty of any MENA nation, while Yemen has the highest prevalence of people living 
      in poverty. These two nations stand out for having suffered the highest rates of 
      many NTDs, including the soil-transmitted nematode infections, filarial infections, 
      schistosomiasis, fascioliasis, leprosy, and trachoma, although they should be 
      recognized for recent measures aimed at NTD control. Leishmaniasis, especially 
      cutaneous leishmaniasis, is endemic in Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Morocco, and 
      elsewhere in the region. Both zoonotic (Leishmania major) and anthroponotic 
      (Leishmania tropica) forms are endemic in MENA in rural arid regions and urban 
      regions, respectively. Other endemic zoonotic NTDs include cystic echinococcosis, 
      fascioliasis, and brucellosis. Dengue is endemic in Saudi Arabia, where Rift Valley 
      fever and Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever have also emerged. Great strides have been made 
      towards elimination of several endemic NTDs, including lymphatic filariasis in Egypt 
      and Yemen; schistosomiasis in Iran, Morocco, and Oman; and trachoma in Morocco, 
      Algeria, Iran, Libya, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. A 
      particularly noteworthy achievement is the long battle waged against schistosomiasis 
      in Egypt, where prevalence has been brought down by regular praziquantel treatment. 
      Conflict and human and animal migrations are key social determinants in preventing 
      the control or elimination of NTDs in the MENA, while local political will, 
      strengthened international and intersectoral cooperative efforts for surveillance, 
      mass drug administration, and vaccination are essential for elimination.

AB  - During investigations into the outbreak of duck viral infection in 2010 in China, 
      with a severe drop in egg production, a flavivirus was isolated from the affected 
      ducks. It was characterized as a Tembusu virus (TMUV). In this study, we obtained a 
      complete genome sequence of Tembusu virus using RT-PCR and RACE techniques. TMUV 
      genome is a singled-stranded RNA, with 10,990 nucleotides in length, and contains a 
      single open reading frame (3410 amino acids) encoding 11 viral proteins with 5'and 
      3'non-translated regions (NTRs) of 142 and 618 nt, respectively. We characterized 
      the open reading frame (ORF) with respect to gene sizes, cleavage sites and 
      potential glycosylation sites. The different genomic regions of the virus were also 
      compared with those of six other flaviviruses including Japanese encephalitis virus, 
      West Nile virus (WNV), dengue-2 virus, yellow fever virus, tick-borne encephalitis 
      virus (TBEV) and Bagaza virus. TMUV demonstrated the highest similarity to Bagaza 
      virus. The result of entire ORF scanning shows that TMUV was close to Bagaza viruses 
      in genetic relatedness. These data demonstrate that TMUV is a unique virus among the 
      mosquito-borne flaviviruses and also provide a useful reference for a critically 
      important study to determine why TMUV is a serious pathogen for ducks.

PG  - 1105-8

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dermatological manifestations are often encountered in paediatric 
      intensive care units (PICU). Spectrum of dermatological problems that may arise in 
      critically ill children in intensive care unit remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim 
      of this study was to find out the burden of dermatological problems and to describe 
      the proportional distribution of paediatric dermatoses in ICU set-up. METHODS: In a 
      retrospective cohort study, we analysed all types of paediatric dermatological 
      conditions manifesting in children admitted to a tertiary level ICU in South India. 
      RESULTS: During the study period of 25 months, 1180 new cases were admitted to PICU. 
      A total of 318 children with 361 skin manifestations were observed. Majority of the 
      skin lesions were minor and were secondary to systemic disease. Infection was the 
      leading cause of dermatoses in ICU. Dengue infection was detected in 64% of total 
      cases included in the study. Stevens-Johnson syndrome was the only primary 
      dermatological condition leading to PICU admission in the present cohort. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum and proportional distribution of skin conditions in 
      children differ from adult ICU-data. Further large-scale investigations are needed 
      to define the characteristics and distribution of infections along with other 
      disease conditions leading to ICU-admissions and mortality among critically ill 
      paediatric patients.

TI  - New genetic variation of Aedes albopictus densovirus isolated from mosquito C6/36 
      cell line.
PG  - 1122-33
AB  - Densovirus (DNV) is a small single-stranded DNA, non-enveloped virus belonging to 
      the subfamily Densovirinae of the Parvoviridae family. This group of invertebrate 
      viruses infects exclusively insects. Two of the major densoviruses, Aedes aegypti 
      (AaeDNV) and Ae. albopictus (AalDNV), infect mosquitoes that carry viruses 
      responsible for two important public health diseases, namely, dengue hemorrhagic 
      fever and yellow fever. The present study describes cloning, sequencing and 
      phylogenetic analysis of a new densovirus, AalDNV-4, from infected Ae. albopictus 
      C6/36 cell line. The total nucleotide sequence (3.9 kb) of AalDNV-4 was obtained 
      from sequencing of DNA fragments, and is 98% homologous to the initial AalDNV 
      previously isolated, and distinguishable from other AalDNVs reported earlier. This 
      full-length viral genome contains a 40-bp deletion at the left terminal region, 12 
      substitutions and 3 indels. Phylogenetic analysis of AalDNV-4 genome indicates that 
      this virus is more closely related to the original AalDNV found in C6/36 cell line 
      than to AaeDNV isolated from other mosquitoes. It was concluded that AalDNV-4 may 
      have been derived from the original DNV found in the C6/36 cell line and has 
      transferred worldwide from the exchange of this cell line among laboratories.

      paradigm.
PG  - 493

LID - 493
AB  - Arboviruses are emerging/reemerging infectious agents worldwide. The factors within 
      this scenario include vector and host population fluctuations, climatic changes, 
      anthropogenic activities that disturb ecosystems, an increase in international 
      flights, human mobility, and genetic mutations that allow spill-over phenomenon. 
      Arboviruses are maintained by biologic transmission among vectors and hosts. 
      Sometimes this biological transmission is specific and includes one vector and host 
      species such as Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV), and urban Yellow Fever (YFV). 
      However, most of the arboviruses are generalist and they use many vectors and hosts 
      species. From this perspective, arboviruses are maintained through a transmission 
      network rather than a transmission cycle. This allows us to understand the 
      complexity and dynamics of the transmission and maintenance of arboviruses in the 
      ecosystems. The old perspective that arboviruses are maintained in close and stable 
      transmission cycles should be modified by a new more integrative and dynamic idea, 
      representing the real scenario where biological interactions have a much broader 
      representation, indicating the constant adaptability of the biological entities.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases in India, e.g., malaria, dengue, chikungunya, filariasis, 
      and Japanese encephalitis cause thousands of deaths per year. Mosquito control is to 
      enhance the health and quality of life of county residents and visitors through the 
      reduction of mosquito populations. Mosquito control is of serious concern in 
      developing countries like India due to the lack of general awareness, development of 
      resistance, and socioeconomic reasons. Noble metal nanoparticles have been used 
      because of their unique optical properties; especially gold and silver have a broad 
      absorption band in the visible region of electromagnetic spectrum. Synthesis of gold 
      nanoparticles using Cymbopogan citratus is an ecofriendly approach for safer 
      environment. C. citratus leaf broth was a good reducing agent that converted 
      chloroauric acid (HAuCl(4)) to metal gold and further heating converted it into 
      nanoparticles. Characterization using UV spectrophotometer, X-ray diffraction, 
      Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, particle size analyzer, and transmission 
      electron microscopy confirmed that the particles are gold nanoparticles ranging 
      between 10 and 110 nm with an average particles size of 20 nm. Further 
      biosynthesized gold nanoparticles and Anthocephalus cadamba were experimented for 
      the larvicidal effect on the filarial vector, Culex quinquefasciatus. Results showed 
      that the gold nanoparticles are much toxic than the plant extract. Observed lethal 
      concentrations (LC(50) and LC(90)) were 1.08 and 2.76 ppm for gold nanoparticles and 
      21.82 and 79.52 ppm for the third instar of C. quinquefasciatus.

TI  - Evaluation of two IgM rapid immunochromatographic tests during circulation of Asian 
      lineage Chikungunya virus.
PG  - 55-61
AB  - Chikungunya is an emerging viral disease, which is clinically difficult to 
      distinguish from dengue. Current laboratory methods to diagnose chikungunya 
      infection, such as virus isolation, RT-PCR and ELISA, are not readily available in 
      many clinical settings. In order to provide a rapid and easy method for the 
      diagnosis of chikungunya infection, rapid immunochromatographic tests to detect 
      chikungunya IgM have recently become commercially available. The sensitivity and 
      specificity of the OnSite Chikungunya IgM Rapid Test-Cassette and the SD Bioline 
      CHIK IgM rapid test were evaluated in comparison to a capture ELISA. The sensitivity 
      of the OnSite test was 20.5% while its specificity was 100%. The sensitivity of the 
      SD Bioline test was 50.8% while its specificity was 89.2%. The sensitivity of the SD 
      Bioline test increased with increasing CHIK IgM titers and with days of onset in 
      samples collected before day 21 of illness. Increasing the reading time from the 
      manufacturer's suggested time of 10 to 20 minutes significantly increased the 
      sensitivity of the SD Bioline test to 68.2%, but did not significantly change its 
      specificity.

TI  - Efficacy of sunlight-activatable porphyrin formulates on larvae of Anopheles gambiae 
      M and S molecular forms and An. arabiensis: a potential novel biolarvicide for 
      integrated malaria vector control.
PG  - 239-43
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.05.011 [doi]
AB  - Biolarvicides, such as microbial formulations based on Bacillus thuringiensis and B. 
      sphaericus, have been found to be highly effective against mosquito larvae and are 
      currently employed as eco-friendly alternatives to synthetic chemical insecticides 
      for vector control. Recently, a porphyrin of natural origin has been suggested as a 
      sunlight-activatable larvicide against the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. In order to 
      validate the approach for the control of the malaria vector, we tested the 
      photo-larvicidal activity of a novel porphyrin, namely meso-tri(N-methyl-pyridyl), 
      mono(N-dodecyl-pyridyl)porphine, C12, associated with two specifically selected 
      carriers, against Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis larvae, both laboratory 
      reared and collected from malaria endemic sites in Burkina Faso. Both C12-porphyrin 
      formulates, when administered to larvae at a 50μM porphyrin dose, were accumulated 
      in the alimentary canal. Subsequent exposure of the porphyrin-loaded larvae to 
      sunlight for short times (0.5-3h) led to a complete mortality. The high efficacy 
      exhibited by a "foodstuff" porphyrin formulate also in the presence of typical 
      larval food particles opens promising perspectives for the development of an 
      effective photocidal larvicide.

TI  - Accuracy of a dual path platform (DPP) assay for the rapid point-of-care diagnosis 
      of human leptospirosis.
PG  - e1878
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001878 [doi]
LID - e1878
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of leptospirosis by the gold standard serologic assay, the 
      microscopic agglutination test (MAT), requires paired sera and is not widely 
      available. We developed a rapid assay using immunodominant Leptospira 
      immunoglobulin-like (Lig) proteins in a Dual Path Platform (DPP). This study aimed 
      to evaluate the assay's diagnostic performance in the setting of urban transmission. 
      METHODOLOGY: We determined test sensitivity using 446 acute and convalescent sera 
      from MAT-confirmed case-patients with severe or mild leptospirosis in Brazil. We 
      assessed test specificity using 677 sera from the following groups: healthy 
      residents of a Brazilian slum with endemic transmission, febrile outpatients from 
      the same slum, healthy blood donors, and patients with dengue, hepatitis A, and 
      syphilis. Three operators independently interpreted visual results without knowing 
      specimen status. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity for paired sera was 100% and 73% 
      for severe and mild disease, respectively. In the acute phase, the assay achieved a 
      sensitivity of 85% and 64% for severe and mild leptospirosis, respectively. Within 
      seven days of illness onset, the assay achieved a sensitivity of 77% for severe 
      disease and 60% for mild leptospirosis. Sensitivity of the DPP assay was similar to 
      that for IgM-ELISA and increased with both duration of symptoms (chi-square 
      regression P = 0.002) and agglutinating titer (Spearman ρ = 0.24, P<0.001). 
      Specificity was ≥93% for dengue, hepatitis A, syphilis, febrile outpatients, and 
      blood donors, while it was 86% for healthy slum residents. Inter-operator agreement 
      ranged from very good to excellent (kappa: 0.82-0.94) and test-to-test 
      reproducibility was also high (kappa: 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: The DPP assay performed 
      acceptably well for diagnosis of severe acute clinical leptospirosis and can be 
      easily implemented in hospitals and health posts where leptospirosis is a major 
      public health problem. However, test accuracy may need improvement for mild disease 
      and early stage leptospirosis, particularly in regions with high transmission.

TI  - Bone marrow examination in pancytopenia.
PG  - 560-2, 566
AB  - Pancytopenia is defined by reduction of all the three formed elements of blood below 
      the normal reference. It may be a manifestation of a wide variety of disorders, 
      which primarily or secondarily affect the bone marrow. Haematological investigation 
      forms the bedrock in the management of patients with pancytopenia and therefore 
      needs detailed study. The total number of cases studied were 100 over a period of 
      two years in the department of pathology, JSS Hospital, Mysore. Megaloblastic 
      anaemia (33%) was the commonest cause of pancytopenia. Other causes were nutritional 
      anaemia (16%), aplastic anaemia (14%), hypersplenism (10%), sepsis (9%) and 
      leukaemia (5%). Less common causes were alcoholic liver disease, haemolytic anaemia, 
      HIV, dengue, systemic lupus erythematosus, viral hepatitis, disseminated TB and 
      multiple myeloma. Most of the patients were in the age group of 11-30 years with a 
      male:female ratio of 1.6:1.Generalised weakness and fatigue (88%) were the commonest 
      presenting complaints. Haemoglobin level varied from 1-10 g/dl with majorIty (70%) 
      of them in the range of 5.1-10 g/dI. TLC was in the range of 500-4000 cells/cmm. 
      Most (34%) of them had 3100-4000 cells/cmm. Platelet count was in the range of 
      4000-1,40,000 cells/cmm. Reticulocyte count varied from 0.1%-15% with majority (82%) 
      of them ranging from 0.1%-2%. The bone marrow cellularity was hypocellular in 14%, 
      hypercellular in 75%, and normocellular in 11% of the patients. Pancytopenia is a 
      relatively common entity with inadequate attention in Indian subcontinent. A 
      comprehensive clinical and haematological study of patients with pancytopenia will 
      usually help in the identification of the underlying cause. However in view of wide 
      array of aetiologies, pancytopenia continues to be a diagnostic challenge for 
      haematologists.

TI  - The health situation among Thai elementary school-age children: 2010.
PG  - S43-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: The school years are a crucial time in the development of the basic life 
      skills necessary for learning in the various and different fields to be encountered 
      in life, as well as for developing and acquiring the knowledge, skills and attitudes 
      necessary to establish and maintain a healthy lifestyle. In general, elementary 
      school-age children rarely present at health service centers but may nevertheless 
      have health problems that affect their ability to learn. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the 
      health situation among elementary school-age children in Thailand, for the creation 
      of baseline information to serve as an evential basis for making recommendations for 
      adjusting the medical education curriculum and for improving health service 
      provision. MATERIAL AND METHOD: To analyze nationwide, hospital data, for the 
      morbidity and mortality of children age 6-12 years in fiscal year 2010. RESULTS: 
      Respiratory infections represented the leading cause for out-patient 
      visits-approximately one-fifth. Respiratory infections were also a significant cause 
      for admissions (21.6%), followed by dengue hemorrhagic fever (14.8%), injury and 
      poisoning (11.3%), disease of digestive system (11.1%) and intestinal infection 
      (10.3%). The leading causes of death were injury and poisoning (22.7%), followed by 
      neoplasm (14.4%), other infection (13.5%) and respiratory infection (12.6%). 
      Overall, about 50-60% of the causes of admissions and of deaths were due to 
      infectious diseases and injury & poisoning. CONCLUSION: Infectious diseases and 
      injury & poisoning were the major physical illnesses among school-age children. 
      Notwithstanding, there were other health issues-including nutrition, growth & 
      development, mental health & psychosocial problems-that need to be recognized and 
      addressed in order to ensure the health and well-being of school-age children in 
      Thailand.

AB  - A cross-sectional study was done on 100 consecutive paediatric patients presenting 
      with acute encephalitis syndrome. The clinico-laboratory features of all patients 
      were recorded in a prestructured performa. Cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples 
      were tested for: Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus; Chandipura virus; coxsackie 
      virus; dengue virus; enterovirus 76; and West Nile virus. Twenty-two (22.0%) 
      patients were confirmed JE cases and 17% had parasitic or bacteriological aetiology. 
      The remaining 61 cases (61.0%) in which no viral aetiological agent was found were 
      grouped as non-JE cases. Peripheral vascular failure, splenomegaly and hypotonia 
      were distinguishing clinical features found in the non-JE patients. A high mortality 
      of 26.5% was seen in patients with confirmed or presumptive viral encephalitis 
      (22/83). A fatal outcome was independently associated with peripheral vascular 
      failure and pallor at the time of admission. Early recognition of these signs may 
      help clinicians to manage these cases.

TI  - Mosquito biting activity on humans & detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection in 
      Anopheles stephensi in Goa, India.
PG  - 120-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Knowledge of the bionomics of mosquitoes, especially of 
      disease vectors, is essential to plan appropriate vector avoidance and control 
      strategies. Information on biting activity of vectors during the night hours in 
      different seasons is important for choosing personal protection measures. This study 
      was carried out to find out the composition of mosquito fauna biting on humans and 
      seasonal biting trends in Goa, India. METHODS: Biting activities of all mosquitoes 
      including vectors were studied from 1800 to 0600 h during 85 nights using human 
      volunteers in 14 different localities of three distinct ecotypes in Goa. Seasonal 
      biting trends of vector species were analysed and compared. Seasonal biting 
      periodicity during different phases of night was also studied using William's mean. 
      RESULTS: A total of 4,191 mosquitoes of five genera and 23 species were collected. 
      Ten species belonged to Anopheles, eight to Culex, three to Aedes and one each to 
      Mansonia and Armigeres. Eleven vector species had human hosts, including malaria 
      vectors Anopheles stephensi (1.3%), An. fluviatilis (1.8%), and An. culicifacies 
      (0.76%); filariasis vectors Culex quinquefasciatus (40.8%) and Mansonia uniformis 
      (1.8%); Japanese encephalitis vectors Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (17.4%), Cx. vishnui 
      (7.7%), Cx. pseudovishnui (0.1%), and Cx. gelidus (2.4%); and dengue and chikungunya 
      vectors Aedes albopictus (0.9%) and Ae. aegypti (0.6%). Two An. stephensi of the 
      total 831 female anophelines, were found positive for P. falciparum sporozoites. The 
      entomological inoculation rate (EIR) of P. falciparum was 18.1 and 2.35 for Panaji 
      city and Goa, respectively. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Most of the mosquito 
      vector species were collected in all seasons and throughout the scotophase. Biting 
      rates of different vector species differed during different phases of night and 
      seasons. Personal protection methods could be used to stop vector-host contact.

AB  - The whole-genome sequencing of mosquitoes has facilitated our understanding of 
      fundamental biological processes at their basic molecular levels and holds potential 
      for application to mosquito control and prevention of mosquito-borne disease 
      transmission. Draft genome sequences are available for Anopheles gambiae, Aedes 
      aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus. Collectively, these represent the major vectors 
      of African malaria, dengue fever and yellow fever viruses, and lymphatic filariasis, 
      respectively. Rapid advances in genome technologies have revealed detailed 
      information on genome architecture as well as phenotype-specific transcriptomics and 
      proteomics. These resources allow for detailed comparative analyses within and 
      across populations as well as species. Next-generation sequencing technologies will 
      likely promote a proliferation of genome sequences for additional mosquito species 
      as well as for individual insects. Here we review the current status of genome 
      research in mosquitoes and identify potential areas for further investigations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Marburg virus and Ebola virus are acute infections with high case 
      fatality rates. A rapid, sensitive detection method was established to detect 
      Marburg virus and Ebola virus by multiplex real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. 
      METHODS: Designing primers and Taqman probes from highly conserved sequences of 
      Marburg virus and Ebola virus through whole genome sequences alignment, Taqman 
      probes labeled by FAM and Texas Red, the sensitivity of the multiplex real-time 
      quantitative PCR assay was optimized by evaluating the different concentrations of 
      primers and Probes. RESULTS: We have developed a real-time PCR method with the 
      sensitivity of 30.5 copies/microl for Marburg virus positive plasmid and 28.6 
      copies/microl for Ebola virus positive plasmids, Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow 
      fever virus, Dengue virus were using to examine the specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      Multiplex real-time PCR assays provide a sensitive, reliable and efficient method to 
      detect Marburg virus and Ebola virus simultaneously.

TI  - Arboviral diseases and malaria in Australia, 2009-10: annual report of the National 
      Arbovirus and Malaria Advisory Committee.
PG  - 70-81
AB  - The National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System received 7,609 notified cases 
      of disease transmitted by mosquitoes for the season 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010. The 
      alphaviruses Barmah Forest virus and Ross River virus, accounted for 6,546 (79%) of 
      these notifications during the 2009-10 season. There were 37 notifications of dengue 
      virus infection locally-acquired from North Queensland and 581 notified cases in 
      Australia that resulted from overseas travel. This number of overseas acquired cases 
      continues to rise each year due to increasing disease activity in the Asia-Pacific 
      region and increased air travel. Detection of flavivirus seroconversions in sentinel 
      chicken flocks across Australia provides an early warning of increased levels of 
      Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Kunjin virus activity. Flavivirus activity was 
      detected in western and northern Australia in 2009-10, which prompted public health 
      action. No human cases of Murray Valley encephalitis virus infection were notified, 
      while there were 2 cases of Kunjin virus infection notified. There were no 
      notifications of locally-acquired malaria in Australia and 429 notifications of 
      overseas-acquired malaria during the 2009-10 season. This annual report presents 
      information of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes in Australia and notified to the 
      National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.

TI  - Proof of concept for a novel insecticide bioassay based on sugar feeding by adult 
      Aedes aegypti (Stegomyia aegypti).
PG  - 284-97

AB  - Aedes aegypti L. (Stegomyia aegypti) (Diptera: Culicidae) is the principal vector of 
      dengue and yellow fever viruses in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. 
      Disease management is largely based on mosquito control achieved by insecticides 
      applied to interior resting surfaces and through space sprays. Population monitoring 
      to detect insecticide resistance is a significant component of integrated disease 
      management programmes. We developed a bioassay method for assessing insecticide 
      susceptibility based on the feeding activity of mosquitoes on plant sugars. Our 
      prototype sugar-insecticide feeding bioassay system was composed of inexpensive, 
      disposable components, contained minimal volumes of insecticide, and was compact and 
      highly transportable. Individual mosquitoes were assayed in a plastic cup that 
      contained a sucrose-permethrin solution. Trypan blue dye was added to create a 
      visual marker in the mosquito's abdomen for ingested sucrose-permethrin solution. 
      Blue faecal spots provided further evidence of solution ingestion. With the 
      sugar-insecticide feeding bioassay, the permethrin susceptibility of Ae. aegypti 
      females from two field-collected strains was characterized by probit analysis of 
      dosage-response data. The field strains were also tested by forced contact of 
      females with permethrin residues on filter paper. Dosage-response patterns were 
      similar, indicating that the sugar-insecticide feeding bioassay had appropriately 
      characterized the permethrin susceptibility of the two strains.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The main constraint to the fight against container-breeding mosquito 
      vectors of human arboviruses is the difficulty in targeting the multiplicity of 
      larval sources, mostly represented by small man-made water containers. The aim of 
      this work is to assess the feasibility of the "auto-dissemination" approach, already 
      tested for Aedes aegypti, as a possible alternative to traditional, inefficient 
      control tools, against Ae. albopictus in urban areas. The approach is based on the 
      possibility that wild adult females, exposed to artificial resting sites 
      contaminated with pyriproxyfen, can disseminate this juvenile hormone analogue to 
      larval habitats, thus interfering with adult emergence. METHODOLOGY: We carried out 
      four field experiments in two areas of Rome that are typically highly infested with 
      Ae. albopictus, i.e. the main cemetery and a small green area within a highly 
      urbanised neighbourhood. In each area we used 10 pyriproxyfen "dissemination" 
      stations, 10 "sentinel" sites and 10 covered, control sites. The sentinel and 
      control sites each contained 25 Ae. albopictus larvae. These were monitored for 
      development and adult emergence. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: When a 5% pyriproxyfen powder 
      was used to contaminate the dissemination sites, we observed significantly higher 
      mortality at the pupal stage in the sentinel sites (50-70%) than in the controls 
      (<2%), showing that pyriproxyfen was transferred by mosquitoes into sentinel sites 
      and that it had a lethal effect. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the potential 
      feasibility of the auto-dissemination approach to control Ae. albopictus in urban 
      areas. Further studies will be carried out to optimize the method and provide an 
      effective tool to reduce the biting nuisance caused by this aggressive species and 
      the transmission risk of diseases such as Dengue and Chikungunya. These arboviruses 
      pose an increasing threat in Europe as Ae. albopictus expands its range.

AB  - An endogenous meiotic driver in the dengue and yellow fever vector mosquito Aedes 
      aegypti can cause highly male-biased sex ratio distortion in crosses from suitable 
      genetic backgrounds. We previously selected a strain that carries a strong meiotic 
      drive gene (D) linked with the male-determining allele (M) on chromosome 1 in A. 
      aegypti. Here, we performed segregation analysis of the M(D) locus among backcross 
      (BC(1)) progeny from a driver male and drive-sensitive females. Assessment of sex 
      ratios among BC(2) progeny showed ∼5.2% recombination between the M(D) locus and the 
      sex determination locus. Multipoint linkage mapping across this region revealed 
      consistent marker orders and recombination frequencies with the existing reference 
      linkage map and placed the M(D) locus within a 6.5-cm interval defined by the LF159 
      locus and microsatellite marker 446GAA, which should facilitate future positional 
      cloning efforts.

TI  - Larvicidal efficacy of the Citrus limetta peel extracts against Indian strains of 
      Anopheles stephensi Liston and Aedes aegypti L.
PG  - 173-8
LID - 10.1007/s00436-011-2814-5 [doi]
AB  - The extracts from the peels of Citrus limetta were prepared using hexane and 
      petroleum ether as the solvents. The larvicidal potential of each extract was 
      assessed against dengue fever vector, Aedes aegypti, and malarial vector, Anopheles 
      stephensi, by evaluating the toxicity effects on early fourth instars. Both the 
      extracts were found effective against both the species. The bioassay with hexane 
      extracts resulted in LC(50) values of 132.45 and 96.15 ppm against A. stephensi and 
      A. aegypti, respectively; while the petroleum ether extracts from the C. limetta 
      peels showed LC(50) values of 244.59 and 145.50 ppm, respectively. It revealed that 
      the hexane extracts possessed 1.9-fold more larvicidal potential against A. 
      stephensi and 1.5-fold more efficacy against A. aegypti as compared to the extracts 
      obtained using petroleum ether as solvent. The data further revealed that the 
      extracts were 1.4-1.7 times more effective against A. aegypti as compared to A. 
      stephensi. The qualitative phytochemical study of the extracts showed the presence 
      of terpenoids and flavonoids as the common phytochemical constituents in the 
      extracts suggesting their possible role in the toxicity. Other constituents tested 
      were not detected except alkaloids which were found to be present only in the 
      petroleum ether extract. Further studies are needed to isolate and identify the 
      active principles involved, their mode of action, formulated preparations for 
      enhancing potency and stability, toxicity, and effects on non-target organisms and 
      the environment. This could help in formulating efficient strategies for mosquito 
      control.

TI  - Stability, oviposition attraction, and larvicidal activity of binary toxin from 
      Bacillus sphaericus expressed in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1235-41
LID - 10.1007/s00253-011-3808-z [doi]
AB  - Bacillus sphaericus produces a two-chain binary toxin composed of BinA (42 kDa) and 
      BinB (51 kDa), which are deposited as parasporal crystals during sporulation. The 
      toxin is highly active against Culex larvae and Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes, 
      which are the principal vectors for the transmission of malaria, yellow fever, 
      encephalitis, and dengue. The use of B. sphaericus and Bacillus thuringiensis in 
      mosquito control programs is limited by their sedimentation in still water. In this 
      study, the binA and binB genes were cloned and the recombinant BinAB protein was 
      expressed in three strains of Escherichia coli. These recombinant strains were used 
      in a toxicity assay against Culex quinquefasciatus larvae. The highest expression 
      level was achieved when both proteins were expressed in a single operon construct. 
      The BinAB protein expressed in the E. coli Arctic strain showed higher larvicidal 
      activity than either of the recombinant proteins from the E. coli Ril or pLysS 
      strains. Furthermore, it had the highest oviposition attraction (49.1%, P < 0.05). 
      These data suggest that biologically active recombinant BinA and BinB toxins might 
      be useful in mosquito control programs, delivered by inactivated bacterial cells or 
      in traps.

TI  - Field evaluations of disposable sticky lures for surveillance of Aedes aegypti 
      (Stegomyia aegypti) and Culex quinquefasciatus in Jakarta.
PG  - 267-75
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2915.2012.01044.x [doi]
AB  - From December 1997 to April 1998, disposable sticky lures (1608 lure days) were 
      trialled in homes in north Jakarta, Indonesia as surveillance tools for Aedes 
      aegypti (Stegomyia aegypti) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Culex quinquefasciatus 
      (Diptera: Culicidae), referenced to indoor resting adult collections (92 × 10 min). 
      The lures collected 89.4% of the total of 1339 Ae. aegypti and 92.1% of the total of 
      1272 Cx. quinquefasciatus collected by all methods. Because there were no 
      significant differences with respect to numbers collected in bedrooms, living rooms 
      and kitchens, bedrooms were selected for subsequent trials for reasons of 
      convenience. The main trials involved a replicated complete block design with 
      L-lysine and sodium carbonate. Lures without attractant or with four different 
      dilutions of L-lysine collected 3.4-8.5 times more Ae. aegypti and 4.2-8.1 times 
      more Cx. quinquefasciatus than were collected by mouth aspirator. Lures with or 
      without dilutions of sodium carbonate collected 2.7-5.0 times more Ae. aegypti and 
      1.8-4.2 times more Cx. quinquefasciatus than aspirator collections. The precision 
      associated with catches of sticky lures was better than that for aspirator 
      collections. Although olfactants generally improved the numbers of mosquitoes 
      collected, the differences in catch between lures with and without attractants were 
      usually non-significant. Any deficit in catch may be offset by increasing the 
      surveillance period to ≥30 days to detect all four dengue serotypes from infected 
      mosquitoes.

      (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae.
PG  - 1478-83
LID - 10.1002/ps.3331 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is a severe public health problem for several countries. In 
      order to find effective larvicides to aid control programs, the structure-activity 
      relationships of eugenol derivatives against Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) 
      larvae were evaluated. Additionally, the composition and larvicidal activity of 
      Syzygium aromaticum essential oil was assessed. RESULTS: Four compounds representing 
      99.05% of S. aromaticum essential oil have been identified. The essential oil was 
      active against Ae. aegypti larvae (LC(50) = 62.3 and 77.0 ppm, field-collected and 
      Rockefeller larvae respectively). The larvicidal activity of eugenol, the major 
      compound of the essential oil, was further evaluated (LC(50) = 93.3 and 71.9 ppm, 
      field-collected and Rockefeller larvae respectively). The larvicidal activity and 
      structure-activity relationships of synthetic derivatives of eugenol were also 
      assessed. The larvicidal activity of the derivatives varied between 62.3 and 1614.9 
      ppm. Oxidation of eugenol allylic bond to a primary alcohol and removal of the 
      phenolic proton resulted in decreased potency. However, oxidation of the same double 
      bond in 1-benzoate-2-methoxy-4-(2-propen-1-yl)-phenol resulted in increased potency. 
      CONCLUSION: Structural characteristics were identified that may contribute to the 
      understanding of the larvicidal activity of phenylpropanoids. The present approach 
      may help future work in the search for larvicidal compounds.

AB  - Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) is the vector of dengue virus in Brazil. Bioinsecticides 
      based on Bacillus thuringiensis have shown satisfactory results in the control of 
      Diptera, due to the production of proteins called Cry and Cyt. The aim of the 
      present study was to select B. thuringiensis isolates carrying the cry and cyt 
      genes, which are efficient in the control of Ae. aegypti. A collection of 27 
      isolates of B. thuringiensis, derived from various regions in Brazil, was evaluated 
      using selective bioassays against A. aegypti larvae. Of the 27 isolates, five showed 
      100% larval mortality at a concentration of 0.05 ppm and the toxicity of these 
      isolates in quantitative bioassays did not differ significantly at temperatures of 
      15, 25 and 35 °C. In addition, these isolates showed statistical differences for the 
      LC50 values only above pH 9, which indicates a maintenance in insecticide potential 
      in a wide range of alkaline pH values. This result is promising, considering that 
      waste treatment reservoirs generally show an acid pH and higher temperatures. These 
      isolates were also evaluated by PCR using specific primers for the genes cry4A, 
      cry4B, cry10A, cry11, cyt1 and cyt2. The analyses demonstrated that all the five 
      isolates showed amplification products for all the studied genes showing four 
      different Cry proteins, besides Cyt proteins. The obtained results of bioassays and 
      PCR demonstrates the great potential for the use of these isolates in controlling 
      populations of Ae. Aegypti and perhaps other species of mosquitoes in a wide range 
      of environments.

AB  - It is generally assumed that the daily probability of survival of mosquitoes is 
      independent of age. To test this assumption we have conducted a three-year 
      experimental fieldwork study (2005-2007) at Fortaleza-CE in Brazil, determining 
      daily survival rates of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti (L.). Survival rates of 
      adult Ae. aegypti may be age-dependent and the statistical analysis is a sensitive 
      approach for comparing patterns of mosquito survival. The mosquito survival data 
      were better fit by a Weibull survival function than by the more traditionally used 
      Gompertz or logistic survival functions. Gompertz, Weibull, or logistic survival 
      functions often fit the survival, and the tails of the survival curves usually 
      appear to fall between the values predicted by the three functions. We corroborate 
      that the mortality of Ae. aegypti in semi-natural conditions may no more be 
      considered as a constant phenomenon during the life of adult mosquitoes but varies 
      according to the age and environmental conditions under a tropical climate. This 
      study estimates the variability in the survival rate of Ae. aegypti and 
      environmental factors that are related to such variability. The statistical analysis 
      shows that the fitting ability, concerning the hazard function, was in decreasing 
      order: Seasonal Cox, the three-parameter Gompertz, and the three-parameter Weibull, 
      that was similar to the three-parameter logistic. The advantage of using the Cox 
      model is that it is convenient for exploring the relationship between survival and 
      several explanatory variables. The Cox model has the advantage of preserving the 
      variable in its original quantitative form and of using a maximum of information. 
      The survival analyses indicate that mosquito mortality is both age- and 
      environment-dependent.

AB  - By transmitting major human diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and filariasis, 
      mosquito species represent a serious threat worldwide in terms of public health, and 
      pose a significant economic burden for the African continent and developing tropical 
      regions. Most vector control programmes aiming at controlling life-threatening 
      mosquitoes rely on the use of chemical insecticides, mainly belonging to the 
      pyrethroid class. However, resistance of mosquito populations to pyrethroids is 
      increasing at a dramatic rate, threatening the efficacy of control programmes 
      throughout insecticide-treated areas, where mosquito-borne diseases are still 
      prevalent. In the absence of new insecticides and efficient alternative vector 
      control methods, resistance management strategies are therefore critical, but these 
      require a deep understanding of adaptive mechanisms underlying resistance. Although 
      insecticide resistance mechanisms are intensively studied in mosquitoes, such 
      adaptation is often considered as the unique result of the selection pressure caused 
      by insecticides used for vector control. Indeed, additional environmental 
      parameters, such as insecticides/pesticides usage in agriculture, the presence of 
      anthropogenic or natural xenobiotics, and biotic interactions between vectors and 
      other organisms, may affect both the overall mosquito responses to pyrethroids and 
      the selection of resistance mechanisms. In this context, the present work aims at 
      updating current knowledge on pyrethroid resistance mechanisms in mosquitoes and 
      compiling available data, often from different research fields, on the impact of the 
      environment on mosquito response to pyrethroids. Key environmental factors, such as 
      the presence of urban or agricultural pollutants and biotic interactions between 
      mosquitoes and their microbiome are discussed, and research perspectives to fill in 
      knowledge gaps are suggested.

AB  - Wolbachia as an endosymbiont is widespread in insects and other arthropods and is 
      best known for reproductive manipulations of the host. Recently, it has been shown 
      that wMelpop and wMel strains of Wolbachia inhibit the replication of several RNA 
      viruses, including dengue virus, and other vector-borne pathogens (e.g., Plasmodium 
      and filarial nematodes) in mosquitoes, providing an alternative approach to limit 
      the transmission of vector-borne pathogens. In this study, we tested the effect of 
      Wolbachia on the replication of West Nile Virus (WNV). Surprisingly, accumulation of 
      the genomic RNA of WNV for all three strains of WNV tested (New York 99, Kunjin, and 
      New South Wales) was enhanced in Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti cells (Aag2). 
      However, the amount of secreted virus was significantly reduced in the presence of 
      Wolbachia. Intrathoracic injections showed that replication of WNV in A. aegypti 
      mosquitoes infected with wMel strain of Wolbachia was not inhibited, whereas wMelPop 
      strain of Wolbachia significantly reduced the replication of WNV in mosquitoes. 
      Further, when wMelPop mosquitoes were orally fed with WNV, virus infection, 
      transmission, and dissemination rates were very low in Wolbachia-free mosquitoes and 
      were completely inhibited in the presence of Wolbachia. The results suggest that (i) 
      despite the enhancement of viral genomic RNA replication in the Wolbachia-infected 
      cell line the production of secreted virus was significantly inhibited, (ii) the 
      antiviral effect in intrathoracically infected mosquitoes depends on the strain of 
      Wolbachia, and (iii) replication of the virus in orally fed mosquitoes was 
      completely inhibited in wMelPop strain of Wolbachia.

AB  - Physiological processes mediate the impact of ecological conditions on the life 
      histories of insect vectors. For the dengue/chikungunya mosquito, Aedes aegypti, 
      three life history traits that are critical to urban population dynamics and control 
      are: size, development rate and starvation mortality. In this paper we make use of 
      prior laboratory experiments on each of these traits at 2°C intervals between 20 and 
      30°C, in conjunction with eco-evolutionary theory and studies on A.aegypti 
      physiology, in order to develop a conceptual and mathematical framework that can 
      predict their thermal sensitivity. Our model of reserve dependent growth (RDG), 
      which considers a potential tradeoff between the accumulation of reserves and 
      structural biomass, was able to robustly predict laboratory observations, providing 
      a qualitative improvement over the approach most commonly used in other A.aegypti 
      models. RDG predictions of reduced size at higher temperatures, but increased 
      reserves relative to size, are supported by the available evidence in Aedes spp. We 
      offer the potentially general hypothesis that temperature-size patterns in 
      mosquitoes are driven by a net benefit of finishing the growing stage with 
      proportionally greater reserves relative to structure at warmer temperatures. By 
      relating basic energy flows to three fundamental life history traits, we provide a 
      mechanistic framework for A.aegypti development to which ecological complexity can 
      be added. Ultimately, this could provide a framework for developing and field 
      testing hypotheses on how processes such as climate variation, density dependent 
      regulation, human behavior or control strategies may influence A.aegypti population 
      dynamics and disease risk.

AB  - The biased usage of synonymous codons affects translational efficiency of genes. We 
      studied codon usage patterns of genes that are perfectly conserved at the amino acid 
      level among three important mosquito vector species: Aedes aegypti (vector of dengue 
      virus), Anopheles gambiae (vector of malaria) and Culex quinquefasciatus (vector of 
      lymphatic filariasis and West Nile Virus). Although these proteins have the same 
      amino acid sequences, non-random usage of synonymous codons is evident among the 
      orthologous genes. The coding sequences of these genes were simulated to generate 
      random mutation sites to be further investigated for patterns of codon bias. It was 
      found that codon usage bias is significantly higher in genes that represented 
      perfectly conserved proteins than genes where variation was apparent at the amino 
      acid sequence. Our results suggest that genes coding for perfectly conserved 
      proteins are highly biased with optimized codons and may be under stringent 
      translational selection in these vector species.

TI  - Expatriates ill after travel: results from the Geosentinel Surveillance Network.
PG  - 386
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-12-386 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expatriates are a distinct population at unique risk for health problems 
      related to their travel exposure. METHODS: We analyzed GeoSentinel data comparing 
      ill returned expatriates with other travelers for demographics, travel 
      characteristics, and proportionate morbidity (PM) for travel-related illness. 
      RESULTS: Our study included 2,883 expatriates and 11,910 non-expatriates who visited 
      GeoSentinel clinics ill after travel. Expatriates were more likely to be male, do 
      volunteer work, be long-stay travelers (>6 months), and have sought pre-travel 
      advice. Compared to non-expatriates, expatriates returning from Africa had higher 
      proportionate morbidity (PM) for malaria, filariasis, schistosomiasis, and hepatitis 
      E; expatriates from the Asia-Pacific region had higher PM for strongyloidiasis, 
      depression, and anxiety; expatriates returning from Latin America had higher PM for 
      mononucleosis and ingestion-related infections (giardiasis, brucellosis). 
      Expatriates returning from all three regions had higher PM for latent TB, amebiasis, 
      and gastrointestinal infections (other than acute diarrhea) compared to 
      non-expatriates. When the data were stratified by travel reason, business 
      expatriates had higher PM for febrile systemic illness (malaria and dengue) and 
      vaccine-preventable infections (hepatitis A), and volunteer expatriates had higher 
      PM for parasitic infections. Expatriates overall had higher adjusted odds ratios for 
      latent TB and lower odds ratios for acute diarrhea and dermatologic illness. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ill returned expatriates differ from other travelers in travel 
      characteristics and proportionate morbidity for specific diseases, based on the 
      region of exposure and travel reason. They are more likely to present with more 
      serious illness.

PG  - 475
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-13-475 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extensive genetic diversity in viral populations within infected hosts 
      and the divergence of variants from existing reference genomes impede the analysis 
      of deep viral sequencing data. A de novo population consensus assembly is valuable 
      both as a single linear representation of the population and as a backbone on which 
      intra-host variants can be accurately mapped. The availability of consensus 
      assemblies and robustly mapped variants are crucial to the genetic study of viral 
      disease progression, transmission dynamics, and viral evolution. Existing de novo 
      assembly techniques fail to robustly assemble ultra-deep sequence data from 
      genetically heterogeneous populations such as viruses into full-length genomes due 
      to the presence of extensive genetic variability, contaminants, and variable 
      sequence coverage. RESULTS: We present VICUNA, a de novo assembly algorithm suitable 
      for generating consensus assemblies from genetically heterogeneous populations. We 
      demonstrate its effectiveness on Dengue, Human Immunodeficiency and West Nile viral 
      populations, representing a range of intra-host diversity. Compared to 
      state-of-the-art assemblers designed for haploid or diploid systems, VICUNA recovers 
      full-length consensus and captures insertion/deletion polymorphisms in diverse 
      samples. Final assemblies maintain a high base calling accuracy. VICUNA program is 
      publicly available at: 
      http://www.broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/science/projects/viral-genomics/ 
      viral-genomics-analysis-software. CONCLUSIONS: We developed VICUNA, a publicly 
      available software tool, that enables consensus assembly of ultra-deep sequence 
      derived from diverse viral populations. While VICUNA was developed for the analysis 
      of viral populations, its application to other heterogeneous sequence data sets such 
      as metagenomic or tumor cell population samples may prove beneficial in these fields 
      of research.

TI  - Mapping vulnerability to climate change and its repercussions on human health in 
      Pakistan.
PG  - 31
LID - 10.1186/1744-8603-8-31 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pakistan is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its geographic 
      location, high dependence on agriculture and water resources, low adaptive capacity 
      of its people, and weak system of emergency preparedness. This paper is the first 
      ever attempt to rank the agro-ecological zones in Pakistan according to their 
      vulnerability to climate change and to identify the potential health repercussions 
      of each manifestation of climate change in the context of Pakistan. METHODS: A 
      climate change vulnerability index is constructed as an un-weighted average of three 
      sub-indices measuring (a) the ecological exposure of each region to climate change, 
      (b) sensitivity of the population to climate change and (c) the adaptive capacity of 
      the population inhabiting a particular region. The regions are ranked according to 
      the value of this index and its components. Since health is one of the most 
      important dimensions of human wellbeing, this paper also identifies the potential 
      health repercussions of each manifestations of climate change and links it with the 
      key manifestations of climate change in the context of Pakistan. RESULTS: The 
      results indicate that Balochistan is the most vulnerable region with high 
      sensitivity and low adaptive capacity followed by low-intensity Punjab (mostly 
      consisting of South Punjab) and Cotton/Wheat Sindh. The health risks that each of 
      these regions face depend upon the type of threat that they face from climate 
      change. Greater incidence of flooding, which may occur due to climate variability, 
      poses the risk of diarrhoea and gastroenteritis; skin and eye Infections; acute 
      respiratory infections; and malaria. Exposure to drought poses the potential health 
      risks in the form of food insecurity and malnutrition; anaemia; night blindness; and 
      scurvy. Increases in temperature pose health risks of heat stroke; malaria; dengue; 
      respiratory diseases; and cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSION: The study concludes 
      that geographical zones that are more exposed to climate change in ecological and 
      geographic terms- such as Balochistan, Low-Intensity Punjab, and Cotton-Wheat Sindh 
      -also happen to be the most deprived regions in Pakistan in terms of socio-economic 
      indicators, suggesting that the government needs to direct its efforts to the 
      socio-economic uplift of these lagging regions to reduce their vulnerability to the 
      adverse effects of climate change.

TI  - Evaluation of bioefficacy of three Citrus essential oils against the dengue vector 
      Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in correlation to their components 
      enantiomeric distribution.
PG  - 2253-63
LID - 10.1007/s00436-012-3074-8 [doi]
AB  - Laboratory experiments were conducted to study the bioefficacy against Ae. 
      albopictus of three Citrus essential oils, derived from peels of Citrus sinensis, 
      Citrus limon, and Citrus paradise and of their components. Chiral gas chromatography 
      analysis revealed the dominant occurrence of R-(+)-limonene and (-)-β-pinene in all 
      three essential oils while in the case of lemon oil γ-terpinene, neral, and geranial 
      detected also among other components. The tested Citrus essential oils were toxic 
      against mosquito larvae with LC(50) values ranging from 25.03 to 37.03 mg l(-1). 
      Among citrus essential oils components tested, γ-terpinene was the most toxic 
      (LC(50) = 20.21 mg l(-1)) followed by both enantiomeric forms of limonene (LC(50) = 
      35.99 and 34.89 mg l(-1), for R-(+)-limonene and S-(-)-limonene, respectively). The 
      delayed toxic effects after exposure of larvae to sublethal (LC(50)) doses were also 
      investigated for citrus essential oils and their major component R-(+)-limonene, 
      indicating a significant reduction of pupal survival. In repellent bioassays, lemon 
      essential oil, S-(-)-limonene, citral (mixture of neral\geranial) and (+)-β-pinene 
      were the most effective compared with other citrus essential oils and components 
      against adult mosquitoes. Repellent bioassays also revealed that limonenes and 
      β-pinenes showed an isomer dependence repellent activity. Finally, according to 
      enantiomeric distribution of limonene and α- and β-pinene, the repellency of lemon 
      essential oil is possibly attributed to the presence of citral.

TI  - Current and future applications of dried blood spots in viral disease management.
PG  - 309-21
LID - 10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.12.011 [doi]
AB  - Almost five decades after their first application in diagnostics, dried blood spot 
      (DBS) cards remain to be of key interest in many research areas and clinical 
      applications. The advantages of sample stability during transport and storage, can 
      now be combined with the high sensitivity of novel diagnostic techniques for the 
      measurement and analysis of nucleic acids, proteins and small molecules which may 
      overcome the limitations of the small samples sizes in DBS cards. Here we present a 
      survey of the literature on the use of DBS cards for diagnosis, monitoring and 
      epidemiological studies of virus infections other than HIV, including CMV, HBV, HCV, 
      HAV, HEV, HTLV, EBV, HSV, measles-, rubella- and dengue-virus. The minimal 
      invasiveness of sampling and the relative ease of handling and storing DBS cards is 
      expected to offer additional opportunities to measure and analyze biomarkers of 
      viral disease in resource poor settings or when limited amount of blood can be 
      obtained. Large retrospective studies of virus infections in newborns using stored 
      DBS cards have already been undertaken for screening of congenital infections. In 
      addition, DBS cards have been used prospectively for prevalence studies, outbreak 
      surveillance, mass screening for viral infections, follow-up of chronic infection 
      and its treatment in resource-limited areas. We do not expect that current wet 
      sampling techniques of plasma or serum will be replaced by DBS sampling but it 
      allows extension of sampling in persons and settings that are currently difficult to 
      access or that lack suitable storage facilities. In conclusion, DBS card sampling 
      and storage will aid adequate outbreak management of existing and emerging viral 
      diseases.

TI  - Characterization of a new highly mosquitocidal isolate of Bacillusthuringiensis--an 
      alternative to Bti?

AB  - The mosquito is a very important vector involved in the worldwide transmission of 
      disease-causing viruses and parasites. Controlling the mosquito population remains 
      one of the best means for preventing the serious infectious diseases of malaria, 
      yellow fever, dengue, filariasis and so on and there has been an increasing interest 
      in developing biopesticides as a useful substitute to chemical insecticides. As a 
      result, Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) has been extensively used 
      due to its specificity and high toxicity to a variety of mosquito larvae. However it 
      is prudent to seek alternatives to Bti with alternative spectra of mosquitocidal 
      activity or that are able to overcome any resistance that might develop against Bti. 
      The Bt S2160-1 strain was isolated from soil samples collected from Southern China 
      and found to have a comparable mosquitocidal activity to Bti. However there were 
      significant differences in terms of their plasmid profiles, crystal proteins 
      produced and cry gene complement. A PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      identification system was developed and used in order to identify novel cry-type 
      genes and four such genes (cry30Ea, cry30Ga, cry50Ba and cry54Ba) were identified in 
      Bt S2160-1. In conclusion, Bt S2160-1 has been identified as a potential alternative 
      to Bti, which could be used for the control of mosquito populations in order to 
      reduce the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases.

AB  - Several diseases are associated to the mosquito-human interaction. Mosquitoes are 
      the carriers of severe and well-known illnesses such as malaria, arboviral 
      encephalitis, dengue fever, chikunguniya fever, West Nile virus, and yellow fever. 
      These diseases produce significant morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock 
      around the world. The adulticidal and repellent activities of crude hexane, ethyl 
      acetate, benzene, chloroform, and methanol extracts of leaf of Eclipta alba and 
      Andrographis paniculata were assayed for their toxicity against two important vector 
      mosquitoes, viz., Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae). The 
      adult mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure. All extracts showed moderate 
      adulticide effects; however, the highest adult mortality was found in methanol 
      extract of A. paniculata against the adults of C. quinquefasciatus and A. aegypti 
      with the LC(50) and LC(90) values were 149.81, 172.37 ppm and 288.12, 321.01 ppm, 
      respectively. The results of the repellent activity of hexane, ethyl acetate, 
      benzene, chloroform, and methanol extract of E. alba and A. paniculata plants at 
      three different concentrations of 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/cm(2) were applied on skin of 
      forearm in man and exposed against adult female mosquitoes. In this observation, 
      these two plant crude extracts gave protection against mosquito bites without any 
      allergic reaction to the test person, and also, the repellent activity is dependent 
      on the strength of the plant extracts. These results suggest that the leaf solvent 
      plant extracts have the potential to be used as an ideal ecofriendly approach for 
      the control of mosquitoes. This is the first report on the mosquito adulticidal and 
      repellent activities of the reported E. alba and A. paniculata plants.

PG  - 567-71
AB  - In order to establish a rapid and accurate method for the detection of Ebola virus 
      (EBOV), the primers used in SYBR Green I real-time RT-PCR were designed based on the 
      EBOV NP gene sequences published in GenBank. The SYBR Green I real-time RT-PCR was 
      established and optimized for the detection of EBOV. The EBOV RNA that was 
      transcribed in vitro was used as a template. The sensitivity of this method was 
      found to reach 1.0 x 10(2) copies/microL and the detection range was 10(2) - 10(10). 
      No cross reaction with RNA samples from Marburg virus, Dengue virus, Xinjiang 
      hemorrhagic fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Influenza virus (H1N1 and 
      H3N2) and Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus E genomic RNA was 
      found. The method would be useful for the detection and monitoring of EBOV in China.

AB  - One class of compounds that has shown promise as antiviral agents are the 
      (S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] (HPMP) nucleosides, members of the 
      broader class of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates. These HPMP nucleosides are 
      nucleotide analogs and have been shown to be effective inhibitors of a wide range of 
      DNA viruses. Prodrugs of these compounds, which achieve higher levels of the active 
      metabolites within the cell, have an expanded activity spectrum that also includes 
      RNA viruses and retroviruses. Because they are analogs of natural nucleotide 
      substrates, HPMP nucleosides are predicted to target polymerases (DNA polymerases, 
      RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases), resulting in the inhibition of viral 
      genome replication. Previous work using the replicative enzymes of different viruses 
      including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and vaccinia virus DNA polymerases and human 
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase has shown that the 
      activated forms of these compounds are substrates for viral polymerases and that 
      incorporation of these compounds into either the primer strand or the template 
      strand inhibits, but does not necessarily terminate, further nucleic acid synthesis. 
      The activity of these compounds against other viruses that do not encode their own 
      polymerases, like polyoma viruses and papilloma viruses, suggests that host cell DNA 
      polymerases are also targeted. This complex mechanism of action and broad activity 
      spectrum has implications for the development of resistance and host cell genome 
      replication, and suggests these compounds may be effective against other viruses 
      such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and Dengue virus. This class of 
      nucleotide analogs also points to a potential avenue for the development of newer 
      antivirals.

AB  - Gene drive systems are genetic elements capable of spreading into a population even 
      if they confer a fitness cost to their host. We consider a class of drive systems 
      consisting of a chromosomally located, linked cluster of genes, the presence of 
      which renders specific classes of offspring arising from specific parental crosses 
      unviable. Under permissive conditions, a number of these elements are capable of 
      distorting the offspring ratio in their favor. We use a population genetic framework 
      to derive conditions under which these elements spread to fixation in a population 
      or induce a population crash. Many of these systems can be engineered using 
      combinations of toxin and antidote genes, analogous to Medea, which consists of a 
      maternal toxin and zygotic antidote. The majority of toxin-antidote drive systems 
      require a critical frequency to be exceeded before they spread into a population. Of 
      particular interest, a Z-linked Medea construct with a recessive antidote is 
      expected to induce an all-male population crash for release frequencies above 50%. 
      We suggest molecular tools that may be used to build these systems, and discuss 
      their relevance to the control of a variety of insect pest species, including 
      mosquito vectors of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.

TI  - Genetic characterization of Chikungunya virus from New Delhi reveal emergence of a 
      new molecular signature in Indian isolates.
PG  - 100
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-9-100 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chikungunya (CHIK) is currently endemic in South and Central India and 
      exist as co-infections with dengue in Northern India. In 2010, New Delhi witnessed 
      an outbreak of CHIK in the months October-December. This was the first incidence of 
      a dominant CHIK outbreak in Delhi and prompted us to characterize the Delhi virus 
      strains. We have also investigated the evolution of CHIK spread in India. FINDINGS: 
      Clinical samples were subjected to RT-PCR to detect CHIK viral RNA. The PCR 
      amplified products were sequenced and the resulting sequences were genetically 
      analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequences of the structural 
      proteins E1 and E2 revealed that the viruses in the latest outbreak exhibited ECSA 
      lineage. Two novel mutations, E1 K211E and E2 V264A were observed in all Delhi 
      isolates. In addition, CHIKV sequences from eight states in India were analyzed 
      along with Delhi sequences to map the genetic diversity of CHIKV within the country. 
      Estimates of average evolutionary divergence within states showed varying divergence 
      among the sequences both within the states and between the states. We identified 
      distinct molecular signatures of the different genotypes of CHIKV revealing 
      emergence of a new signature in the New Delhi clade. Statistical analyses and 
      construction of evolutionary path of the virus within the country revealed gradual 
      spread of one specific strain all over the country. CONCLUSION: This study has 
      identified unique mutations in the E1 and E2 genes and has revealed the presence of 
      ancestral CHIKV population with maximum diversity circulating in Maharashtra. The 
      study has further revealed the trend of CHIK spread in India since its first report 
      in 1963 and its subsequent reappearance in 2005.

LID - e1002500
AB  - Mosquito host-seeking behavior and heterogeneity in host distribution are important 
      factors in predicting the transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne infections such as 
      dengue fever, malaria, chikungunya, and West Nile virus. We develop and analyze a 
      new mathematical model to describe the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the 
      contact rate between mosquito vectors and hosts. The model includes odor plumes 
      generated by spatially distributed hosts, wind velocity, and mosquito behavior based 
      on both the prevailing wind and the odor plume. On a spatial scale of meters and a 
      time scale of minutes, we compare the effectiveness of different plume-finding and 
      plume-tracking strategies that mosquitoes could use to locate a host. The results 
      show that two different models of chemotaxis are capable of producing comparable 
      results given appropriate parameter choices and that host finding is optimized by a 
      strategy of flying across the wind until the odor plume is intercepted. We also 
      assess the impact of changing the level of host aggregation on mosquito host-finding 
      success near the end of the host-seeking flight. When clusters of hosts are more 
      tightly associated on smaller patches, the odor plume is narrower and the biting 
      rate per host is decreased. For two host groups of unequal number but equal spatial 
      density, the biting rate per host is lower in the group with more individuals, 
      indicative of an attack abatement effect of host aggregation. We discuss how this 
      approach could assist parameter choices in compartmental models that do not 
      explicitly model the spatial arrangement of individuals and how the model could 
      address larger spatial scales and other probability models for mosquito behavior, 
      such as Lévy distributions.

      against mosquito vectors.

LID - 10.1007/s00436-012-2925-7 [doi]
AB  - Plant-based insecticides for vector control are urgently needed for Anopheles 
      barbirostris, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Aedes albopictus which are the primary 
      vectors of malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and dengue, respectively, in India and 
      other South East Asian countries. In the present study, larvicidal, adulticidal, and 
      repellent activities of acetone root bark extract of Hiptage benghalensis were 
      tested against the larvae and adults of the three mosquito vectors. The acetone root 
      bark extracts of H. benghalensis was more effective as larvicides with low LC(50) 
      (11.15-16.78 ppm) and LT50 (1.25-4.84 h at 200 and 400 ppm) values. Results of log 
      probit analysis (at 95 % confidence level) and regression analysis of crude acetone 
      root bark extract of H. benghalensis revealed that lethal concentration (LC(50)) 
      values gradually decreased with the exposure periods; lethal time (LT(50)) decreased 
      with the concentration, and the mortality is positively correlated with the 
      concentration. The order of susceptibility of the three mosquito species was as 
      follows: A. albopictus > A. barbirostris > C. quinquefascitus. Biochemical changes 
      were also evidenced in third instar larvae of three mosquito species following a 
      sublethal exposure for 24 h. The level of sugar, glycogen, lipids, and proteins was 
      significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in larvae treated with H. benghalensis. The acetone 
      root bark extracts of H. benghalensis is less toxic to adults and repelled 
      laboratory-reared female A. barbirostris, A. albopictus, and C. quinquefascitus with 
      the short median protection times of 57.66-135, 72.41-134.16, and 47.66-93 min, 
      respectively. The present investigation proves it as a potent larvicide against A. 
      albopictus, A. barbirostris, and C. quinquefascitus, which can be recommended to 
      control these mosquito species on its breeding site. However, further investigations 
      are needed to confirm the lethal effects of H. benghalensis in field conditions and 
      its impact on the nontarget organisms.

TI  - Quantitative determination of IgM antibodies reduces the pitfalls in the 
      serodiagnosis of tick-borne encephalitis.
PG  - 115-20
LID - 10.1016/j.jcv.2012.02.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most important arbovirus disease in 
      parts of Europe and Asia. Its laboratory diagnosis depends on the detection of 
      specific IgM antibodies which can be impeded by (1) long-time persistence of IgM 
      antibodies after infection, (2) vaccine-induced IgM antibodies, and (3) 
      cross-reactive IgM antibodies from other flavivirus infections. OBJECTIVES: To 
      assess the extent of interference factors in the serodiagnosis of TBE that might 
      lead to the false positive assignment of a recent infection. STUDY DESIGN: We 
      quantified TBE virus-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in sera collected at different 
      time points from cohorts of (1) 61 TBE patients, (2) 131 TBE vaccinees, and (3) 42 
      patients with recent dengue or West Nile virus infections. RESULTS: All of the TBE 
      patients were IgM- and IgG-positive upon hospitalization and 87% of acute TBE sera 
      had IgM antibody titers of >500 Arbitrary Units (AU). These titers rapidly declined 
      and only 16% of TBE patients had low IgM titers ≥9 months after infection. 
      Vaccine-induced as well as flavivirus cross-reactive IgM antibodies were rarely 
      detectable and of low titer. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the potential problems of TBE 
      serodiagnosis can be resolved by the quantification of IgM antibodies in a single 
      serum sample taken upon hospitalization. High IgM values (>500 AU in our assay) are 
      indicative of a recent infection. Lower IgM values, however, may require the 
      analysis of a follow-up sample and/or a specific neutralization assay to exclude the 
      possibilities of IgM persistence, vaccine-induced IgM antibodies or heterologous 
      flavivirus infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The spread of Aedes albopictus, a vector for re-emergent arbovirus 
      diseases like chikungunya and dengue, points up the need for better control 
      strategies and new tools to evaluate transmission risk. Human antibody (Ab) 
      responses to mosquito salivary proteins could represent a reliable biomarker for 
      evaluating human-vector contact and the efficacy of control programs. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used ELISA tests to evaluate specific 
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to salivary gland extracts (SGE) in adults exposed 
      to Aedes albopictus in Reunion Island. The percentage of immune responders (88%) and 
      levels of anti-SGE IgG Abs were high in exposed individuals. At an individual level, 
      our results indicate heterogeneity of the exposure to Aedes albopictus bites. In 
      addition, low-level immune cross-reactivity between Aedes albopictus and Aedes 
      aegypti SGEs was observed, mainly in the highest responders. 
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Ab responses to saliva could be used as an 
      immuno-epidemiological tool for evaluating exposure to Aedes albopictus bites. 
      Combined with entomological and epidemiological methods, a "salivary" biomarker of 
      exposure to Aedes albopictus could enhance surveillance of its spread and the risk 
      of arbovirus transmission, and could be used as a direct tool for the evaluation of 
      Aedes albopictus control strategies.

AB  - Identification of synthetic peptide substrates for novel peptidases is an essential 
      step for their study. With this purpose we synthesized fluorescence resonance energy 
      transfer (FRET) peptide libraries Abz (or MCA)-GXXXXXQ-EDDnp and Abz (or 
      MCA)-GXXZXXQ-EDDnp, where X consists of an equimolar mixture of all amino acids, the 
      Z position is fixed with one of the proteinogenic amino acids (cysteine was 
      excluded), Abz (ortho-aminobenzoic acid) or MCA ([7-amino-4-methyl]coumarin) is the 
      fluorescence donor and Q-EDDnp (glutamine-[N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-ethylenediamine]) 
      is the fluorescence acceptor. The peptide libraries MCA-GXXX↓XXQ-EDDnp and 
      MCA-GXXZ↓XXQ-EDDnp were cleaved as indicated (↓) by trypsin, chymotrypsin, cathepsin 
      L, pepsin A, and Eqolisin as confirmed by Edman degradation of the products derived 
      from the digestion of these libraries. The best hydrolyzed Abz-GXXZXXQ-EDDnp 
      sublibraries by these proteases, including Dengue 2 virus NS2B-NS3 protease, 
      contained amino acids at the Z position that are reported to be well accepted by 
      their S(1) subsite. The pH profiles of the hydrolytic activities of these canonical 
      proteases on the libraries were similar to those reported for typical substrates. 
      The FRET peptide libraries provide an efficient and simple approach for detecting 
      nanomolar concentrations of endopeptidases and are useful for initial specificity 
      characterization as performed for two proteases secreted by a Bacillus subtilis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate travel-associated morbidity in European 
      travellers in 2009 in comparison with 2008, with a particular emphasis on emerging 
      infectious diseases with the potential for introduction into Europe. Diagnoses with 
      demographic, clinical and travel-related predictors of disease from ill returning 
      travelers presenting to 12 core EuroTravNet sites from January to December 2009 were 
      analysed. A total of 6392 patients were seen at EuroTravNet core sites in 2009, as 
      compared with 6957 in 2008. As compared with 2008, there was a marked increase in 
      the number of travellers exposed in North America and western Europe. Respiratory 
      illnesses, in particular pandemic A(H1N1) influenza, influenza-like syndromes, and 
      tuberculosis, were also observed more frequently. A significant increase in reported 
      dengue cases in 2009 as compared with 2008 was observed (n = 172, 2.7% vs. n = 131, 
      1.90%) (p 0.002). The numbers of malaria and chikungunya cases were also increasing, 
      although not significantly. Two deaths were recorded: visceral leishmaniasis and 
      sepsis in a Sudanese migrant, and Acinetobacter sp. pneumonia in a patient who had 
      visited Spain. This is the most comprehensive study of travel-related illness in 
      Europe in 2009 as compared with 2008. A significant increase in travel-related 
      respiratory and vector-borne infections was observed, highlighting the potential 
      risk for introduction of these diseases into Europe, where competent vectors are 
      present. The number of traveller deaths is probably underestimated. The possible 
      role of the travellers in the emergence of infectious diseases of public health 
      concern is highlighted.

TI  - Emerging viral infections‑-a potential threat for blood supply in the 21st century.
PG  - 279-89
AB  - During the last 25 years the safety of blood products has improved dramatically with 
      regard to infectious risk, notably to the threat represented by retroviruses (HIV 
      and human T‑cell lymphotropic virus) and hepatitis B and C viruses. However, both 
      residual and emergent viral infections are still responsible for contaminations in 
      recipients of blood products. Along with other viruses (human herpesvirus‑8, human 
      parvovirus B19, hepatitis A and E viruses, etc.), special attention has recently 
      been paid to emerging arboviruses, such as West Nile virus in North America, and 
      Dengue and Chikungunya viruses in Europe. Another blood‑linked risk, notably in the 
      United Kingdom and France, is the prion agent responsible for the variant form of 
      the Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease. Hemophilia care has been the model for improvements 
      in the safety and availability of safe blood components free of infectious agents. 
      In this regard, several measures aimed to halt transmission of viruses have been 
      implemented in blood banks, including the exclusion of at‑risk donors, specific 
      sensitive diagnostic tests, leukocyte reduction of labile blood products, and the 
      physical or chemical treatments aiming at nonspecific inactivation of infectious 
      agents potentially present in blood without impairing significantly its 
      physiological properties.

AB  - Highly multiplexed assays, such as microarrays, can benefit arbovirus surveillance 
      by allowing researchers to screen for hundreds of targets at once. We evaluated 
      amplification strategies and the practicality of a portable DNA microarray platform 
      to analyze virus-infected mosquitoes. The prototype microarray design used here 
      targeted the non-structural protein 5, ribosomal RNA, and cytochrome b genes for the 
      detection of flaviviruses, mosquitoes, and bloodmeals, respectively. We identified 
      13 of 14 flaviviruses from virus inoculated mosquitoes and cultured cells. 
      Additionally, we differentiated between four mosquito genera and eight whole blood 
      samples. The microarray platform was field evaluated in Thailand and successfully 
      identified flaviviruses (Culex flavivirus, dengue-3, and Japanese encephalitis 
      viruses), differentiated between mosquito genera (Aedes, Armigeres, Culex, and 
      Mansonia), and detected mammalian bloodmeals (human and dog). We showed that the 
      microarray platform and amplification strategies described here can be used to 
      discern specific information on a wide variety of viruses and their vectors.

AB  - The present study evaluated the Orthosiphon thymiflorus leaf extract and the 
      bacterial insecticide spinosad, testing the first to fourth instars larvae and pupae 
      of two important vector mosquitoes, viz., Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi. The 
      fresh leaves of O. thymiflorus were washed thoroughly in tap water and shade-dried 
      at room temperature (28 ± 2 °C) for 5 to 8 days. The air-dried materials were 
      powdered separately using a commercial electrical blender. From the plants, 500 g 
      powder was macerated with 1.5 L organic solvents of petroleum ether sequentially for 
      a period of 72 h each and then filtered. The larval and pupal mortality was observed 
      after 24 h of exposure; no mortality was observed in the control group. The first- 
      to fourth-instar larvae and pupae of A. stephensi had values of LC(50) = 309.16, 
      337.58, 390.42, 429.68, and 513.34 ppm, and A. aegypti had values of LC(50) = 
      334.78, 366.45, 422.97, 467.94, and 54.02 ppm, respectively. Spinosad against the A. 
      stephensi had values of LC(50) = 384.19, 433.39, 479.17, 519.79, and 572.63 ppm, and 
      A. aegypti had values of LC(50) = 210.68, 241.20, 264.93, 283.27, and 305.85 ppm, 
      respectively. Moreover, in combined treatment, the A. stephensi had values of LC(50) 
      = 202.36, 224.76, 250.84, 288.05, and 324.05 ppm, and A. aegypti had values of 
      LC(50) = 217.70, 246.04, 275.36, 315.29, and 353.80 ppm, respectively. Results 
      showed that the leaf extract of O. thymiflorus and bacterial insecticide spinosad 
      are promising as a good larvicidal and pupicidal against dengue vector, A. aegypti 
      and malarial vector, A. stephensi. This is an ideal eco-friendly approach for the 
      control of target species of vector control programs.

TI  - Utility of IgM ELISA, TaqMan real-time PCR, reverse transcription PCR, and RT-LAMP 
      assay for the diagnosis of Chikungunya fever.
PG  - 1771-8
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23406 [doi]
AB  - Chikungunya fever a re-emerging infection with expanding geographical boundaries, 
      can mimic symptoms of other infections like dengue, malaria which makes the 
      definitive diagnosis of the infection important. The present study compares the 
      utility of four laboratory diagnostic methods viz. IgM capture ELISA, an in house 
      reverse transcription PCR for the diagnosis of Chikungunya fever, TaqMan real-time 
      PCR, and a one step reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification 
      assay (RT-LAMP). Out of the 70 serum samples tested, 29 (41%) were positive for 
      Chikungunya IgM antibody by ELISA and 50 (71%) samples were positive by one of the 
      three molecular assays. CHIKV specific nucleic acid was detected in 33/70 (47%) by 
      reverse transcription PCR, 46/70 (66%) by TaqMan real-time PCR, and 43/70 (62%) by 
      RT-LAMP assay. A majority of the samples (62/70; 89%) were positive by at least one 
      of the four assays used in the study. The molecular assays were more sensitive for 
      diagnosis in the early stages of illness (2-5 days post onset) when antibodies were 
      not detectable. In the later stages of illness, the IgM ELISA is a more sensitive 
      diagnostic test. In conclusion we recommend that the IgM ELISA be used as an initial 
      screening test followed one of the molecular assays in samples that are collected in 
      the early phase of illness and negative for CHIKV IgM antibodies. Such as approach 
      would enable rapid confirmation of the diagnosis and implementation of public health 
      measures especially during outbreaks.

LID - e1002838
AB  - Natural killer T cells (NKT cells) represent a subset of T lymphocytes that express 
      natural killer (NK) cell surface markers. A subset of NKT cells, termed invariant 
      NKT cells (iNKT), express a highly restricted T cell receptor (TCR) and respond to 
      CD1d-restricted lipid ligands. iNKT cells are now appreciated to play an important 
      role in linking innate and adaptive immune responses and have been implicated in 
      infectious disease, allergy, asthma, autoimmunity, and tumor surveillance. Advances 
      in iNKT identification and purification have allowed for the detailed study of iNKT 
      activity in both humans and mice during a variety of chronic and acute infections. 
      Comparison of iNKT function between non-pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus 
      (SIV) infection models and chronic HIV-infected patients implies a role for iNKT 
      activity in controlling immune activation. In vitro studies of influenza infection 
      have revealed novel effector functions of iNKT cells including IL-22 production and 
      modulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, but ex vivo characterization of 
      human iNKT cells during influenza infection are lacking. Similarly, as recent 
      evidence suggests iNKT involvement in dengue virus pathogenesis, iNKT cells may 
      modulate responses to a number of emerging pathogens. This Review will summarize 
      current knowledge of iNKT involvement in responses to viral infections in both human 
      and mouse models and will identify critical gaps in knowledge and opportunities for 
      future study. We will also highlight recent efforts to harness iNKT ligands as 
      vaccine adjuvants capable of improving vaccination-induced cellular immune 
      responses.

TI  - Lightweight noninvasive trauma monitor for early indication of central hypovolemia 
      and tissue acidosis: a review.
PG  - S106-11
LID - 10.1097/TA.0b013e318260a928 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage is a major cause of soldier death; it must be quickly 
      identified and appropriately treated. We developed a prototype patient monitor that 
      noninvasively and continuously determines muscle oxygen saturation (SmO₂), muscle pH 
      (pHm), and a regional assessment of blood volume (HbT) using near-infrared 
      spectroscopy. Previous demonstration in a model of progressive, central hypovolemia 
      induced by lower body negative pressure (LBNP) showed that SmO₂ provided an early 
      indication of impending hemodynamic instability in humans. In this review, we expand 
      the number of subjects and provide an overview of the relationship between the 
      muscle and sublingual microcirculation in this model of compensated shock. METHODS: 
      Healthy human volunteers (n = 30) underwent progressive LBNP in 5-minute intervals. 
      Standard vital signs, along with stroke volume (SV), total peripheral resistance, 
      functional capillary density, SmO₂, HbT, and pHm were measured continuously 
      throughout the study. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: SmO₂ and SV significantly decreased 
      during the first level of central hypovolemia (-15 mm Hg LBNP), whereas vital signs 
      were later indicators of impending cardiovascular collapse. SmO₂ declined with SV 
      and inversely with total peripheral resistance throughout LBNP. HbT was correlated 
      with declining functional capillary density, suggesting vasoconstriction as a cause 
      for decreased SmO₂ and subsequently decreased pHm. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: The monitor 
      has been miniaturized to a 58-g solid-state sensor that is currently being evaluated 
      on patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever. Early results demonstrate significant 
      decreases in SmO₂ similar to those observed with progressive reductions in central 
      blood volume. As such, this technology has the potential to (1) provide a monitoring 
      capability for both nontraumatic and traumatic hemorrhage and (2) help combat medics 
      triage casualties and monitor patients during lengthy transport from combat areas.

TI  - Isolation of Bacillus thuringiensis strains that contain Dipteran-specific cry genes

AB  - The entomophatogenic bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produces crystal proteins, 
      named Cry proteins which are encoded by the cry genes. This bacterium is used on 
      biological control of important economical pests, as well as in the control of 
      disease´s vectors, such as Aedes aegypti, a mosquito that transmits the dengue 
      viruses. Isolates of this bacterium can be characterized by the content of cry genes 
      and this prediction helps target different insect orders. In this research, we 
      isolated 76 colonies of B. thuringiensis from 30 soil samples that were taken from 
      Ilha Bela (SP, Brazil), a place where simulids are already biologically controlled 
      by B. thuringiensis, to find bacterial isolates that were capable of controlling A. 
      aegypti. The 16S ribosomal subunit genes of the selected isolates were sequenced, 
      and the isolates were molecularly characterized based on their Dipteran-specific cry 
      gene contents. Eight of the 76 isolates (10.52%) contained the cry4Aa, cry4Ba or 
      cry10Aa genes, these isolates were carried out against A. aegypti larvae on 
      bioassay. The presence or absence of specific cry genes was associated with the 
      observed average larval mortalities. From the 76 isolates, seven (9.2%) were 
      potentially able to control A. aegypti larvae. Therefore these are promising 
      isolates for the biological control of A. aegypti larvae.

AB  - Global climate change can potentially increase the transmission of mosquito 
      vector-borne diseases such as malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and dengue in many 
      parts of the world. These predictions are based on the effects of changing 
      temperature, rainfall, and humidity on mosquito breeding and survival, the more 
      rapid development of ingested pathogens in mosquitoes and the more frequent blood 
      feeds at moderately higher ambient temperatures. An expansion of saline and brackish 
      water bodies (water with <0.5 ppt or parts per thousand, 0.5-30 ppt and >30 ppt salt 
      are termed fresh, brackish, and saline respectively) will also take place as a 
      result of global warming causing a rise in sea levels in coastal zones. Its possible 
      impact on the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases has, however, not been 
      adequately appreciated. The relevant impacts of global climate change on the 
      transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in coastal zones are discussed with 
      reference to the Ross-McDonald equation and modeling studies. Evidence is presented 
      to show that an expansion of brackish water bodies in coastal zones can increase the 
      densities of salinity-tolerant mosquitoes like Anopheles sundaicus and Culex 
      sitiens, and lead to the adaptation of fresh water mosquito vectors like Anopheles 
      culicifacies, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Aedes albopictus to salinity. 
      Rising sea levels may therefore act synergistically with global climate change to 
      increase the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in coastal zones. Greater 
      attention therefore needs to be devoted to monitoring disease incidence and 
      preimaginal development of vector mosquitoes in artificial and natural coastal 
      brackish/saline habitats. It is important that national and international health 
      agencies are aware of the increased risk of mosquito-borne diseases in coastal zones 
      and develop preventive and mitigating strategies. Application of appropriate counter 
      measures can greatly reduce the potential for increased coastal transmission of 
      mosquito-borne diseases consequent to climate change and a rise in sea levels. It is 
      proposed that the Jaffna peninsula in Sri Lanka may be a useful case study for the 
      impact of rising sea levels on mosquito vectors in tropical coasts.

AB  - Aedes albopictus, a species known to transmit dengue and chikungunya viruses, is 
      primarily a container-inhabiting mosquito. The potential for pathogen transmission 
      by Ae. albopictus has increased our need to understand its ecology and population 
      dynamics. Two parameters that we know little about are the impact of direct 
      density-dependence and delayed density-dependence in the larval stage. The present 
      study uses a manipulative experimental design, under field conditions, to understand 
      the impact of delayed density dependence in a natural population of Ae. albopictus 
      in Raleigh, North Carolina. Twenty liter buckets, divided in half prior to 
      experimentation, placed in the field accumulated rainwater and detritus, providing 
      oviposition and larval production sites for natural populations of Ae. albopictus. 
      Two treatments, a larvae present and larvae absent treatment, were produced in each 
      bucket. After five weeks all larvae were removed from both treatments and the 
      buckets were covered with fine mesh cloth. Equal numbers of first instars were added 
      to both treatments in every bucket. Pupae were collected daily and adults were 
      frozen as they emerged. We found a significant impact of delayed density-dependence 
      on larval survival, development time and adult body size in containers with high 
      larval densities. Our results indicate that delayed density-dependence will have 
      negative impacts on the mosquito population when larval densities are high enough to 
      deplete accessible nutrients faster than the rate of natural food accumulation.

LID - 10.1007/s00436-012-2921-y [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is a day-biting, highly anthropophilic mosquito and a potential vector 
      of dengue and chikungunya in India. A. aegypti is a container breeder, generally 
      oviposit in the stored and fresh water bodies, and discarded containers near 
      residential areas that provide suitable habitats for oviposition by gravid females. 
      The diurnal activity and endophilic nature of these mosquitoes have increased the 
      frequency of contact with human being. Assured blood meal from human host in an 
      infested area leads to increased disease occurrence. Gravid mosquitoes can 
      potentially be lured to attractant-treated traps and could subsequently be killed 
      with insecticides or growth regulators. In this direction, oviposition by A. aegypti 
      females to aryl hydrazono esters (AHE)-treated bowls at 10 ppm concentration was 
      tested in dual choice experiment, and their orientation response to these ester 
      compounds was studied in Y-tube olfactometer. Among the esters tested, AHE-2, AHE-11 
      and AHE-12 elicited increased egg deposition with oviposition activity indices (OAI) 
      of +0.39, +0.24 and +0.48, respectively, compared to control; in contrast, AHE-8, 
      AHE-9 and AHE-10 showed negative oviposition response with OAI of -0.46, -0.35 and 
      -0.29, respectively, at 10 mg/L. In the Y-tube olfactometer bioassay, AHE-2 
      attracted 60 % females compared to control, while to the odour of AHE-11 and AHE-12, 
      about 70 % of the females were trapped in treated chambers. In contrast, only 27-30 
      % of gravid females entered the chamber releasing AHE-8, AHE-9 and AHE-10 odour 
      plumes, while 70 % entered control chamber, evincing a possible non-preference of 
      treatment odours as well as interference with olfactory receptors. These compounds 
      have the potential for application as oviposition stimulants or deterrents for 
      surveillance and control of mosquito population using ovitraps.

TI  - Arthropod Surveillance Programs: Basic Components, Strategies, and Analysis.
PG  - 135-149
AB  - Effective entomological surveillance planning stresses a careful consideration of 
      methodology, trapping technologies, and analysis techniques. Herein, the basic 
      principles and technological components of arthropod surveillance plans are 
      described, as promoted in the symposium "Advancements in arthropod monitoring 
      technology, techniques, and analysis" presented at the 58th annual meeting of the 
      Entomological Society of America in San Diego, CA. Interdisciplinary examples of 
      arthropod monitoring for urban, medical, and veterinary applications are reviewed. 
      Arthropod surveillance consists of the three components: 1) sampling method, 2) trap 
      technology, and 3) analysis technique. A sampling method consists of selecting the 
      best device or collection technique for a specific location and sampling at the 
      proper spatial distribution, optimal duration, and frequency to achieve the 
      surveillance objective. Optimized sampling methods are discussed for several 
      mosquito species (Diptera: Culicidae) and ticks (Acari: Ixodidae). The advantages 
      and limitations of novel terrestrial and aerial insect traps, artificial pheromones 
      and kairomones are presented for the capture of red flour beetle (Coleoptera: 
      Tenebrionidae), small hive beetle (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), bed bugs (Hemiptera: 
      Cimicidae), and Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) respectively. After sampling, 
      extrapolating real world population numbers from trap capture data are possible with 
      the appropriate analysis techniques. Examples of this extrapolation and action 
      thresholds are given for termites (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) and red flour beetles.

AB  - Mayaro virus produces nonspecific, sublethal disease symptoms, often confused with 
      dengue, but with symptoms of arthalgias that can cause incapacitating disability. 
      Outbreaks have been localized and sporadic in the Pan-Amazonia forest since its 
      first isolation in 1954 (Trinidad and Tobago). The literature available is scarce, 
      diverse and dispersed. Mayaro virus is an alphavirus, phylogenetically related to 
      the Semliki forest antigenic complex. UNA and Mayaro viruses are the only viruses of 
      this complex that have been isolated in the New World. Mayaro consists of 
      single-stranded RNA of positive charge, length of 12 kb, subdivided into genomic and 
      subgenomic regions, which encode nonstructural and structural proteins respectively. 
      Mayaro shows a great plasticity in vertebrate host infection, whereas high 
      specificity in the family Culicidae (mosquitoes). Risk factors of infection are 
      associated with forest areas of northern South America and the rainy season. Two 
      genotypes of MAYV have been identified, L (Belterra, Brazil) and D (widely 
      distributed in the Pan-Amazonia). The enzootic cycle is similar to the jungle cycle 
      of yellow fever, which involves Haemagogus mosquitoes and monkeys as reservoirs. 
      However, the involvement of other secondary vectors and other hosts may be important 
      in spread of the virus. Humans may have high levels of viremia, and efficient 
      experimental transmission has been demonstrated in Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus 
      and Aedes scapularis, suggesting a significant risk to public health in urban, rural 
      and peridomestic locations close to enzootic foci of Mayaro virus.

      vector control interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquito transgenesis offers new promises for the genetic control of 
      vector-borne infectious diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Genetic control 
      strategies require the release of large number of male mosquitoes into field 
      populations, whether they are based on the use of sterile males (sterile insect 
      technique, SIT) or on introducing genetic traits conferring refractoriness to 
      disease transmission (population replacement). However, the current absence of 
      high-throughput techniques for sorting different mosquito populations impairs the 
      application of these control measures. METHODS: A method was developed to generate 
      large mosquito populations of the desired sex and genotype. This method combines 
      flow cytometry and the use of Anopheles gambiae transgenic lines that differentially 
      express fluorescent markers in males and females. RESULTS: Fluorescence-assisted 
      sorting allowed single-step isolation of homozygous transgenic mosquitoes from a 
      mixed population. This method was also used to select wild-type males only with high 
      efficiency and accuracy, a highly desirable tool for genetic control strategies 
      where the release of transgenic individuals may be problematic. Importantly, sorted 
      males showed normal mating ability compared to their unsorted brothers. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The developed method will greatly facilitate both laboratory studies of mosquito 
      vectorial capacity requiring high-throughput approaches and future field 
      interventions in the fight against infectious disease vectors.

TI  - Mating compatibility and competitiveness of transgenic and wild type Aedes aegypti 
      (L.) under contained semi-field conditions.

AB  - We conducted the world's first experiments under semi-field conditions (ACL-2 field 
      house) to assess the mating competitiveness of genetically sterile RIDL male 
      mosquitoes (513A strain). The field house is a state-of-the-art, fully-contained 
      trial facility, simulating the living space for a household of 2-4 people in 
      Peninsular Malaysia. Ten genetically sterile RIDL male A. aegypti mosquitoes 
      competed with ten wild type males inside this field house to mate with ten wild type 
      females. Hatched larvae from mated females were screened under a fluorescent 
      microscope for genetic markers to determine if they were fathered by RIDL male or 
      wild type male, and all results were cross-checked by PCR. Two such experiments were 
      conducted, each repeated sufficient number of times. All strains were on a Malaysian 
      lab strain background for the first experiment, while the RIDL males alone were on a 
      recently-colonised Mexican strain background for the second experiment. A total of 
      52 % of the matings were with RIDL males in the first experiment, while 45 % of the 
      matings were with RIDL (Mexican) males in the second experiment. Statistically, this 
      is not significantly different from 50 % of the matings expected to take place with 
      RIDL males if the latter were as competitive as that of the wild type males. This 
      shows that A. aegypti RIDL-513A has excellent mating competitiveness under 
      semi-field conditions, verifying earlier trends obtained in small lab cages. We also 
      observed high mating compatibility between recently-colonised Mexican RIDL males and 
      lab-reared Malaysian wild type females.

TI  - West Nile virus infection causes endocytosis of a specific subset of tight junction 
      membrane proteins.
PG  - e37886
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0037886 [doi]
LID - e37886
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a blood-borne pathogen that causes systemic infections and 
      serious neurological disease in human and animals. The most common route of 
      infection is mosquito bites and therefore, the virus must cross a number of 
      polarized cell layers to gain access to organ tissue and the central nervous system. 
      Resistance to trans-cellular movement of macromolecules between epithelial and 
      endothelial cells is mediated by tight junction complexes. While a number of recent 
      studies have documented that WNV infection negatively impacts the barrier function 
      of tight junctions, the intracellular mechanism by which this occurs is poorly 
      understood. In the present study, we report that endocytosis of a subset of tight 
      junction membrane proteins including claudin-1 and JAM-1 occurs in WNV infected 
      epithelial and endothelial cells. This process, which ultimately results in 
      lysosomal degradation of the proteins, is dependent on the GTPase dynamin and 
      microtubule-based transport. Finally, infection of polarized cells with the related 
      flavivirus, Dengue virus-2, did not result in significant loss of tight junction 
      membrane proteins. These results suggest that neurotropic flaviviruses such as WNV 
      modulate the host cell environment differently than hemorrhagic flaviviruses and 
      thus may have implications for understanding the molecular basis for neuroinvasion.

TI  - Population genetic structure of Aedes polynesiensis in the Society Islands of French 
      Polynesia: implications for control using a Wolbachia-based autocidal strategy.
PG  - 80
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-80 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes polynesiensis is the primary vector of Wuchereria bancrofti in the 
      South Pacific and an important vector of dengue virus. An improved understanding of 
      the mosquito population genetics is needed for insight into the population dynamics 
      and dispersal, which can aid in understanding the epidemiology of disease 
      transmission and control of the vector. In light of the potential release of a 
      Wolbachia infected strain for vector control, our objectives were to investigate the 
      microgeographical and temporal population genetic structure of A. polynesiensis 
      within the Society Islands of French Polynesia, and to compare the genetic 
      background of a laboratory strain intended for release into its population of 
      origin. METHODS: A panel of eight microsatellite loci were used to genotype A. 
      polynesiensis samples collected in French Polynesia from 2005-2008 and introgressed 
      A. polynesiensis and Aedes riversi laboratory strains. Examination of genetic 
      differentiation was performed using F-statistics, STRUCTURE, and an AMOVA. BAYESASS 
      was used to estimate direction and rates of mosquito movement. RESULTS: FST values, 
      AMOVA, and STRUCTURE analyses suggest low levels of intra-island differentiation 
      from multiple collection sites on Tahiti, Raiatea, and Maupiti. Significant 
      pair-wise FST values translate to relatively minor levels of inter-island genetic 
      differentiation between more isolated islands and little differentiation between 
      islands with greater commercial traffic (i.e., Tahiti, Raiatea, and Moorea). 
      STRUCTURE analyses also indicate two population groups across the Society Islands, 
      and the genetic makeup of Wolbachia infected strains intended for release is similar 
      to that of wild-type populations from its island of origin, and unlike that of A. 
      riversi. CONCLUSIONS: The observed panmictic population on Tahiti, Raiatea, and 
      Moorea is consistent with hypothesized gene flow occurring between islands that have 
      relatively high levels of air and maritime traffic, compared to that of the more 
      isolated Maupiti and Tahaa. Gene flow and potential mosquito movement is discussed 
      in relation to trials of applied autocidal strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 million people travel each year from industrialized countries 
      to destinations in the tropics and subtropics. Among them, there are more than 2 
      million minors traveling. Although their number is increasing constantly, data on 
      health risks during travel are limited. METHODS: This study analyzed demographic, 
      travel, and clinical data of 890 travelers of age <20 years presenting at the 
      outpatient travel clinic of the University of Munich between 1999 and 2009 after 
      returning from the tropics and subtropics. RESULTS: Most (87%) of these young 
      travelers were born in Germany. Among them, the main travel destination was Africa 
      (46%), followed by Asia (35%) and Latin America (19%). The most frequent syndrome 
      groups were acute diarrhea (25%, especially in age 0-4 y), dermatologic disorders 
      (21%, especially in age 0-9 y), febrile/systemic diseases (20%), respiratory 
      disorders (8%), chronic diarrhea (5%), and genitourinary disorders (3%). The 10 most 
      frequent diagnosed infectious diseases were giardiasis (8%), schistosomiasis (4%), 
      superinfected insect bites (4%), Campylobacter enteritis (4%), Salmonella enteritis 
      (4%), cutaneous larva migrans (3%), amebiasis (3%), dengue fever (2%), mononucleosis 
      (2%), and malaria (2%). The relative risk (RR) for acquiring any infectious disease 
      during travel was highest in Central, West, and East Africa, followed by South 
      America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. CONCLUSIONS: Age of young travelers and 
      destination of travel were the most important variables being strongly correlated

      highest risk was carried by very young travelers and those staying in sub-Saharan 
      Africa (except Southern Africa).

AB  - Aedes aegypti dispersion is the major reason for the increase in dengue transmission 
      in South America. In Brazil, control of this mosquito strongly relies on the use of 
      pyrethroids and organophosphates against adults and larvae, respectively. In 
      consequence, many Ae. aegypti field populations are resistant to these compounds. 
      Resistance has a significant adaptive value in the presence of insecticide 
      treatment. However some selected mechanisms can influence important biological 
      processes, leading to a high fitness cost in the absence of insecticide pressure. We 
      investigated the dynamics of insecticide resistance and its potential fitness cost 
      in five field populations and in a lineage selected for deltamethrin resistance in 
      the laboratory, for nine generations. For all populations the life-trait parameters 
      investigated were larval development, sex ratio, adult longevity, relative amount of 
      ingested blood, rate of ovipositing females, size of egglaying and eggs viability. 
      In the five natural populations, the effects on the life-trait parameters were 
      discrete but directly proportional to resistance level. In addition, several 
      viability parameters were strongly affected in the laboratory selected population 
      compared to its unselected control. Our results suggest that mechanisms selected for 
      organophosphate and pyrethroid resistance caused the accumulation of alleles with 
      negative effects on different life-traits and corroborate the hypothesis that 
      insecticide resistance is associated with a high fitness cost.

AB  - A digital light modulation system that utilizes a modified commercial digital 
      micromirror device (DMD) projector, which is equipped with a UV light-emitting diode 
      as a light modulation source, has been developed to spatially direct excited light 
      toward a microwell array device to detect the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of 
      single cells via phase-based phosphorescence lifetime detection. The microwell array 
      device is composed of a combination of two components: an array of glass microwells 
      containing Pt(II) octaethylporphine (PtOEP) as the oxygen-sensitive luminescent 
      layer and a microfluidic module with pneumatically actuated glass lids set above the 
      microwells to controllably seal the microwells of interest. By controlling the 
      illumination pattern on the DMD, the modulated excitation light can be spatially 
      projected to only excite the sealed microwell for cellular OCR measurements. The OCR 
      of baby hamster kidney-21 fibroblast cells cultivated on the PtOEP layer within a 
      sealed microwell has been successfully measured at 104 ± 2.96 amol s(-1) cell(-1). 
      Repeatable and consistent measurements indicate that the oxygen measurements did not 
      adversely affect the physiological state of the measured cells. The OCR of the cells 
      exhibited a good linear relationship with the diameter of the microwells, ranging 
      from 400 to 1000 μm and containing approximately 480 to 1200 cells within a 
      microwell. In addition, the OCR variation of single cells in situ infected by Dengue 
      virus with a different multiplicity of infection was also successfully measured in 
      real-time. This proposed platform provides the potential for a wide range of 
      biological applications in cell-based biosensing, toxicology, and drug discovery.

AB  - The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC), Division of Global Emerging 
      Infections Surveillance and Response System conducts disease surveillance through a 
      global network of US Department of Defense research laboratories and partnerships 
      with foreign ministries of agriculture, health and livestock development in over 90 
      countries worldwide. In 2010, AFHSC supported zoonosis survey efforts were organized 
      into four main categories: (i) development of field assays for animal disease 
      surveillance during deployments and in resource limited environments, (ii) 
      determining zoonotic disease prevalence in high-contact species which may serve as 
      important reservoirs of diseases and sources of transmission, (iii) surveillance in 
      high-risk human populations which are more likely to become exposed and subsequently 
      infected with zoonotic pathogens and (iv) surveillance at the human-animal interface 
      examining zoonotic disease prevalence and transmission within and between human and 
      animal populations. These efforts have aided in the detection, identification and 
      quantification of the burden of zoonotic diseases such as anthrax, brucellosis, 
      Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, dengue fever, Hantaan virus, influenza, Lassa 
      fever, leptospirosis, melioidosis, Q fever, Rift Valley fever, sandfly fever 
      Sicilian virus, sandfly fever Naples virus, tuberculosis and West Nile virus, which 
      are of military and public health importance. Future zoonotic surveillance efforts 
      will seek to develop local capacity for zoonotic surveillance focusing on high risk 
      populations at the human-animal interface.

TI  - Advanced vaccine candidates for Lassa fever.
PG  - 2514-57
LID - 10.3390/v4112514 [doi]
AB  - Lassa virus (LASV) is the most prominent human pathogen of the Arenaviridae. The 
      virus is transmitted to humans by a rodent reservoir, Mastomys natalensis, and is 
      capable of causing lethal Lassa Fever (LF). LASV has the highest human impact of any 
      of the viral hemorrhagic fevers (with the exception of Dengue Fever) with an 
      estimated several hundred thousand infections annually, resulting in thousands of 
      deaths in Western Africa. The sizeable disease burden, numerous imported cases of LF 
      in non-endemic countries, and the possibility that LASV can be used as an agent of 
      biological warfare make a strong case for vaccine development. Presently there is no 
      licensed vaccine against LF or approved treatment. Recently, several promising 
      vaccine candidates have been developed which can potentially target different groups 
      at risk. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the LASV pathogenesis and 
      immune mechanisms involved in protection. The current status of pre-clinical 
      development of the advanced vaccine candidates that have been tested in non-human 
      primates will be discussed. Major scientific, manufacturing, and regulatory 
      challenges will also be considered.

TI  - The sterile insect technique for controlling populations of Aedes albopictus

AB  - Reunion Island suffers from high densities of the chikungunya and dengue vector 
      Aedes albopictus. The sterile insect technique (SIT) offers a promising strategy for 
      mosquito-borne diseases prevention and control. For such a strategy to be effective, 
      sterile males need to be competitive enough to fulfil their intended function by 
      reducing wild mosquito populations in natura. We studied the effect of irradiation 
      on sexual maturation and mating success of males, and compared the sexual 
      competitiveness of sterile versus wild males in the presence of wild females in 
      semi-field conditions. For all untreated or sterile males, sexual maturation was 
      completed within 13 to 20 h post-emergence and some males were able to inseminate 
      females when 15 h old. In the absence of competition, untreated and sterile males 
      were able to inseminate the same number of virgin females during 48 h, in small 
      laboratory cages: an average of 93% of females was inseminated no matter the 
      treatment, the age of males, and the sex ratio. Daily mating success of single 
      sterile males followed the same pattern as for untreated ones, although they 
      inseminated significantly fewer females after the ninth day. The competitiveness 
      index of sterile males in semi-field conditions was only 0.14 when they were 
      released at 1-day old, but improved to 0.53 when the release occurred after a 5-day 
      period in laboratory conditions. In SIT simulation experiments, a 5:1 sterile to 
      wild male ratio allowed a two-fold reduction of the wild population's fertility. 
      This suggests that sterile males could be sufficiently competitive to mate with wild 
      females within the framework of an SIT component as part of an AW-IPM programme for 
      suppressing a wild population of Ae. albopictus in Reunion Island. It will be of 
      interest to minimise the pre-release period in controlled conditions to ensure a 
      good competitiveness without increasing mass rearing costs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A major impediment to performing virological field studies in developing 
      nations is the lack of ultra-low freezers as well as the expense and difficulty of 
      shipping frozen samples. A commercially available product, ViveST™, was developed to 
      preserve nucleic acids at ambient temperature for use in specimen storage and 
      transportation. However, its applications as a viral storage, transport and recovery 
      device have not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of ViveST to 
      preserve live virus following storage at ambient temperature. STUDY DESIGN: A panel 
      of six viruses was stored at ambient temperature (~22°C) in ViveST with fetal bovine 
      serum (FBS), or ViveST with minimal essential media (MEM) and compared with virus 
      stored in universal transport media (M4RT), MEM, and FBS alone. Stored viruses 
      included: human adenovirus (14p), dengue virus 2 (16608), echovirus 3 (Morrisey), 
      human rhinovirus 15 (1734), Coxsackie virus B5 (Faulkner), and herpes simplex virus 
      1 (HF). After 7 days storage at ambient temperature, virus recovery was measured via 
      titration using viral plaque assays or focus-forming unit assays. RESULTS: Viral 
      titer studies indicate that ViveST with either FBS or M4RT preserved/recovered 5 
      different viruses for 1 week at ambient temperature. MEM preserved 4 viruses while 
      FBS and ViveST with MEM preserved 3 viruses each. Statistical analyses indicate that 
      M4RT and ViveST with FBS preserved significantly more virus than the other 
      treatments. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that ViveST with either FBS or M4RT may 
      be useful in field specimen collection scenarios where ultra-cold storage is not 
      available.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever pose a major health problem 
      through much of the world. One approach to disease prevention involves the use of 
      selfish genetic elements to drive disease-refractory genes into wild mosquito 
      populations. Recently engineered synthetic drive systems have provided encouragement 
      for this strategy; but at the same time have been greeted with caution over the 
      concern that transgenes may spread into countries and communities without their 
      consent. Consequently, there is also interest in gene drive systems that, while 
      strong enough to bring about local population replacement, are unable to establish 
      themselves beyond a partially isolated release site, at least during the testing 
      phase. Here, we develop simple deterministic and stochastic models to compare the 
      confinement properties of a variety of gene drive systems. Our results highlight 
      several systems with desirable features for confinement-a high migration rate 
      required to become established in neighboring populations, and low-frequency 
      persistence in neighboring populations for moderate migration rates. Single-allele 
      underdominance and single-locus engineered underdominance have the strongest 
      confinement properties, but are difficult to engineer and require a high 
      introduction frequency, respectively. Toxin-antidote systems such as Semele, Merea 
      and two-locus engineered underdominance show promising confinement properties and 
      require lower introduction frequencies. Killer-rescue is self-limiting in time, but 
      is able to disperse to significant levels in neighboring populations. We discuss the 
      significance of these results in the context of a phased release of transgenic 
      mosquitoes, and the need for characterization of local ecology prior to a release.

AB  - The human RPSA [ribosomal protein SA; also known as LamR1(laminin receptor 1)] 
      belongs to the ribosome but is also a membrane receptor for laminin, growth factors, 
      prion, pathogens and the anticarcinogen EGCG (epigallocatechin-gallate). It 
      contributes to the crossing of the blood-brain barrier by neurotropic viruses and 
      bacteria, and is a biomarker of metastasis. RPSA includes an N-terminal domain, 
      which is folded and homologous to the prokaryotic RPS2, and a C-terminal extension, 
      which is intrinsically disordered and conserved in vertebrates. We used recombinant 
      derivatives of RPSA and its N- and C-domains to quantify its interactions with 
      ligands by in-vitro immunochemical and spectrofluorimetric methods. Both N- and 
      C-domains bound laminin with K(D) (dissociation constants) of 300 nM. Heparin bound 
      only to the N-domain and competed for binding to laminin with the negatively charged 
      C-domain, which therefore mimicked heparin. EGCG bound only to the N-domain with a 
      K(D) of 100 nM. Domain 3 of the envelope protein from yellow fever virus and 
      serotypes-1 and -2 of dengue virus bound preferentially to the C-domain whereas that 
      from West Nile virus bound only to the N-domain. Our quantitative in-vitro approach 
      should help clarify the mechanisms of action of RPSA, and ultimately fight against 
      cancer and infectious agents.

      importance, and identification keys.
PG  - 207
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-207 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During recent periods, the islands of the Republic of Seychelles 
      experienced many diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Bancroft's filaria and 
      malaria. Mosquitoes transmit the agents that cause these diseases. Published 
      information on mosquitoes in the Seychelles is notably dispersed in the literature. 
      The maximum number of species obtained on a single field survey does not exceed 14 
      species. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive bibliographic review using mosquito 
      and Seychelles as the key words, as well as conducted a mosquito field survey for 
      larval and adult stages during the rainy season in December 2008. Sixteen sites were 
      sampled on four granitic islands (Mahé, Praslin, La Digue and Aride) and six sites 
      on coralline atolls in the extreme southwest of the country (Aldabra group). 
      RESULTS: We found published references to 21 mosquito species identified at least on 
      one occasion in the Seychelles. Our collections comprised 18 species of mosquitoes, 
      all of them from the subfamily Culicinae; no Anophelinae was found. We also confirm 
      that Aedes seychellensis is a junior synonym of Ae. (Aedimorphus) albocephalus. The 
      first records for Culex antennatus and Cx. sunyaniensis are presented from the 
      country, specifically from Aldabra and Praslin, respectively. Based on a comparison 
      of the taxa occurring on the granitic versus coralline islands, only three species, 
      Ae. albocephalus, Cx. scottii and Cx. simpsoni are shared. Aedes albopictus appeared 
      to exclude largely Ae. aegypti on the granitic islands; however, Ae. aegypti was 
      common on Aldabra, where Ae. albopictus has not been recorded. The notable 
      aggressiveness of mosquitoes towards humans on coralline islands was mainly due to 
      two species, the females of which are difficult to distinguish: Ae. fryeri and Ae. 
      (Aedimorphus) sp. A. The number of mosquito species collected at least once in the 
      Seychelles is now 22, among which five species (Ae. (Adm) sp. A, Cx. stellatus, 
      Uranotaenia browni. Ur. nepenthes and Ur. pandani) and one subspecies (Ae. vigilax 
      vansomerenae) are considered as endemic. Two illustrated identification keys, one 
      for adult females and the other for larval stages, are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      knowledge of the culicidian fauna in the Seychelles has been notably updated. The 
      number of mosquito species is relatively large with regards to land surface and 
      distances to continental Africa, although the anophelines are totally lacking. The 
      complex natural history of mosquitoes in the Seychelles provides examples of both 
      vicariance- and dispersal-mediated divergences. They present superb examples for 
      theoretical and applied island biology.

AB  - Studies were carried out to evaluate the role of a C(21)-fatty acid ester; propyl 
      octadecanoate (PO) for olfaction-mediated behavioral responses of urban malaria 
      vector, Anopheles stephensi and dengue vector, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using 
      electroantennogram (EAG), flight orientation and oviposition experiments. Dose 
      dependent electrophysiological responses were recorded for PO from the antenna of 
      both mosquito species in which 10(-5) g elicited significant EAG response. An. 
      stephensi exhibited 2.4, 4.2 and 5.5 fold increased EAG response compared to 
      control, while Ae. aegypti showed 1.9, 4.6 and 5.8 fold EAG responses respectively 
      at 10(-7) g, 10(-6) g and 10(-5) g doses. In the Y-tube olfactometer, 77-80% gravid 
      females of An. stephensi, and 64-77% of Ae. aegypti were caught in the chambers 
      releasing 10(-6) g and 10(-5) g plume of PO. The synthetic fatty acid ester loaded 
      onto an effervescent tablet at 0.1 mg/L, 1 mg/L and 10 mg/L elicited increased 
      ovipositional responses from gravid mosquitoes compared to control. The oviposition 
      activity indices (OAI) of An. stephensi females were +0.40, +0.51 and +0.58, whereas 
      the OAI for Ae. aegypti females were +0.05, +0.36 and +0.57 respectively in 0.1, 1, 
      10 mg/L of PO; indicated concentration dependent increased egg deposition. 
      Similarly, in the residual activity studies, oviposition substrates treated with PO 
      on effervescent tablet at 1mg/L and 10mg/L received significantly increased egg 
      deposition by gravid females of both mosquito species for up to 1 week compared to 
      control substrates. PO can potentially be used in ovitraps to monitor An. stephensi 
      and Ae. aegypti populations in the vector surveillance programs.

TI  - CD8+ T cells use TRAIL to restrict West Nile virus pathogenesis by controlling 
      infection in neurons.
PG  - 8937-48
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00673-12 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies of mice have demonstrated that an orchestrated sequence of innate 
      and adaptive immune responses is required to control West Nile virus (WNV) infection 
      in peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Tumor necrosis 
      factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; also known as CD253) has been 
      reported to inhibit infection with dengue virus, a closely related flavivirus, in 
      cell culture. To determine the physiological function of TRAIL in the context of 
      flavivirus infection, we compared the pathogenesis of WNV in wild-type and 
      TRAIL(-/-) mice. Mice lacking TRAIL showed increased vulnerability and death after 
      subcutaneous WNV infection. Although no difference in viral burden was detected in 
      peripheral tissues, greater viral infection was detected in the brain and spinal 
      cord at late times after infection, and this was associated with delayed viral 
      clearance in the few surviving TRAIL(-/-) mice. While priming of adaptive B and T 
      cell responses and trafficking of immune and antigen-specific cells to the brain 
      were undistinguishable from those in normal mice, in TRAIL(-/-) mice, CD8(+) T cells 
      showed qualitative defects in the ability to clear WNV infection. Adoptive transfer 
      of WNV-primed wild-type but not TRAIL(-/-) CD8(+) T cells to recipient CD8(-/-) mice 
      efficiently limited infection in the brain and spinal cord, and analogous results 
      were obtained when wild-type or TRAIL(-/-) CD8(+) T cells were added to WNV-infected 
      primary cortical neuron cultures ex vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that 
      TRAIL produced by CD8(+) T cells contributes to disease resolution by helping to 
      clear WNV infection from neurons in the central nervous system.

TI  - [An imported Chikungunya fever case from New Delhi, India to Ankara, Turkey: the 
      first imported case of Turkey and review of the literature].
PG  - 122-8
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that causes an acute 
      febrile illness, chikungunya fever. CHIKV virus is geographically distributed in 
      Africa, India, and South-East Asia. Chikungunya fever outbreaks have been reported 
      from India since 2006. The incubation period is 3-7 days, and the disease is 
      characterized by sudden onset of high fever and severe arthralgia. Other symptoms 
      can be rash, headache, fatigue, nausea-vomiting, and myalgias. Here, we report the 
      first Chikungunya case imported from India, New-Delhi to Ankara, Turkey. In December 
      2010, a 55-year-old female Turkish government employee living in urban area of New 
      Delhi for the last 3 years had sudden onset fever up to 38.4°C for 2 days. Itching 
      rash and arthralgia also developed. Symptomatic treatment was given to patient in 
      New Delhi. She returned to Turkey and was admitted to Hacettepe University Medical 
      Faculty, Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases Unit, since arthralgia 
      has continued on the 26th day of her complaints. Hepatomegaly and tenosynovitis were 
      detected in her physical examination. Serum sample sent to Refik Saydam National 
      Public Health Agency, Virology Reference and Research Laboratory, yielded negative 
      results for specific IgM and IgG antibodies against Hantavirus and Dengue virus 
      types 1-4; however, the results were positive for CHIKV specific IgM and IgG 
      antibodies by commercial immunofluorescence method (Euroimmun, Germany). CHIKV RNA 
      which was searched by in-house real-time RT-PCR was negative. The second serum 
      sample obtained three weeks later also found positive for CHIKV specific IgM and IgG 
      antibodies. This was the first laboratory confirmed imported Chikungunya case in 
      Turkey. There are predictions regarding the presence of Aedes species mosquitos that 
      can transmit this virus in Turkey. This case report will be an alarming signal for 
      the clinicians in our country to consider Chikungunya fever in the differential 
      diagnosis of patients presenting with fever, arthralgia and rash.

TI  - Physiological and morphological aspects of Aedes aegypti developing larvae: effects 
      of the chitin synthesis inhibitor novaluron.
PG  - e30363

AB  - Population control of the dengue vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is difficult due to 
      many reasons, one being the development of resistance to neurotoxic insecticides 
      employed. The biosynthesis of chitin, a major constituent of insect cuticle, is a 
      novel target for population control. Novaluron is a benzoylphenylurea (BPU) that 
      acts as a chitin synthesis inhibitor, already used against mosquitoes. However, 
      information regarding BPU effects on immature mosquito stages and physiological 
      parameters related with mosquito larval development are scarce. A set of 
      physiological parameters were recorded in control developing larvae and novaluron 
      was administered continuously to Ae. aegypti larvae, since early third instar. 
      Larval instar period duration was recorded from third instar until pupation. Chitin 
      content was measured during third and fourth instars. Fourth instars were processed 
      histochemically at the mesothorax region, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) 
      for assessment of internal tissues, and labeled with WGA-FITC to reveal chitinized 
      structures. In control larvae: i) there is a chitin content increase during both 
      third and fourth instars where late third instars contain more chitin than early 
      fourth instars; ii) thoracic organs and a continuous cuticle, closely associated 
      with the underlying epidermis were observed; iii) chitin was continuously present 
      throughout integument cuticle. Novaluron treatment inhibited adult emergence, 
      induced immature mortality, altered adult sex ratio and caused delay in larval 
      development. Moreover, novaluron: i) significantly affected chitin content during 
      larval development; ii) induced a discontinuous and altered cuticle in some regions 
      while epidermis was often thinner or missing; iii) rendered chitin cuticle presence 
      discontinuous and less evident. In both control and novaluron larvae, chitin was 
      present in the peritrophic matrix. This study showed quantitatively and 
      qualitatively evidences of novaluron effects on Ae. aegypti larval development. To 
      our knowledge, this is the first report describing histological alterations produced 
      by a BPU in immature vector mosquitoes.

TI  - Public perceptions and behaviours related to the risk of infection with Aedes 
      mosquito-borne diseases: a cross-sectional study in Southeastern France.
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2012-002094 [doi]
LID - e002094
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore public perceptions and behaviours related to the risk of 
      flavivirus and alphavirus infection in Southeastern regions of France following the 
      recent colonisation of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, and the 
      identification of four autochthonous cases of dengue and chikungunya fever in these 
      regions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone survey using a proportional random digit 
      dialling selection method. SETTING: Interviews were conducted from 28 November 2011 
      to 29 January 2012 using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system. 
      PARTICIPANTS: 1506 French speaking adults aged 18 years or older residing in French 
      Mediterranean regions. RESULTS: Protective health behaviours were found to be 
      performed less frequently among men (AOR=0.65, 95% CI 0.52% to 0.80%), residents 
      with lower educational status (AOR=0.61, 95% CI 0.43% to 0.85% for respondents with 
      primary school education; AOR=0.69, 95% CI 0.53% to 0.90% for those with some 
      secondary school education), and those living in regions where the Aedes mosquito is 
      objectively rare (AOR=0.60, 95% CI 0.36% to 0.98% for Aude; AOR=0.63, 95% CI 0.44% 
      to 0.89% for Herault; AOR=0.56, 95% CI 0.34% to 0.93% for Eastern Pyrenees). 
      Empirical results also suggest that behavioural responses to infection risk are 
      greater shaped by the perceived exposure to Aedes, notably the perceived frequency 
      of mosquito bites (AOR=2.07, 95% CI 1.84% to 2.32%) and visual identification of 
      Aedes mosquitoes in one's immediate environment (AOR=1.98, 95% CI 1.45% to 2.71%) 
      rather than by other common predictors of protective behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings may help with the development of innovative instruments designed to make 
      more visible and personal the threat of flavivirus and alphavirus infections induced 
      by the presence of A albopictus in order to promote significant behavioural changes 
      among populations at risk.

TI  - Noncoding flavivirus RNA displays RNA interference suppressor activity in insect and 
      Mammalian cells.
PG  - 13486-500
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01104-12 [doi]
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV) are highly pathogenic, mosquito-borne 
      flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae) that cause severe disease and death in humans. 
      WNV and DENV actively replicate in mosquitoes and human hosts and thus encounter 
      different host immune responses. RNA interference (RNAi) is the predominant 
      antiviral response against invading RNA viruses in insects and plants. As a 
      countermeasure, plant and insect RNA viruses encode RNA silencing suppressor (RSS) 
      proteins to block the generation/activity of small interfering RNA (siRNA). Enhanced 
      flavivirus replication in mosquitoes depleted for RNAi factors suggests an important 
      biological role for RNAi in restricting virus replication, but it has remained 
      unclear whether or not flaviviruses counteract RNAi via expression of an RSS. First, 
      we established that flaviviral RNA replication suppressed siRNA-induced gene 
      silencing in WNV and DENV replicon-expressing cells. Next, we showed that none of 
      the WNV encoded proteins displayed RSS activity in mammalian and insect cells and in 
      plants by using robust RNAi suppressor assays. In contrast, we found that the 
      3'-untranslated region-derived RNA molecule known as subgenomic flavivirus RNA 
      (sfRNA) efficiently suppressed siRNA- and miRNA-induced RNAi pathways in both 
      mammalian and insect cells. We also showed that WNV sfRNA inhibits in vitro cleavage 
      of double-stranded RNA by Dicer. The results of the present study suggest a novel 
      role for sfRNA, i.e., as a nucleic acid-based regulator of RNAi pathways, a strategy 
      that may be conserved among flaviviruses.

PG  - 17-22
LID - 10.1016/j.envint.2012.05.007 [doi]
AB  - There is an assumption that pyrethroid pesticides are converted to non-toxic 
      metabolites by hydrolysis in mammals. However, some recent works have shown their 
      bioaccumulation in human breast milk collected in areas where pyrethroids have been 
      widely used for agriculture or malaria control. In this work, thirteen pyrethroids 
      have been studied in human breast milk samples coming from areas without pyrethroid 
      use for malaria control, such as Brazil, Colombia and Spain. The concentrations of 
      pyrethroids ranged from 1.45 to 24.2 ng g⁻¹ lw. Cypermethrin, λ-cyhalothrin, 
      permethrin and esfenvalerate/fenvalerate were present in all the studied samples. 
      The composition of pyrethroid mixture depended on the country of origin of the 
      samples, bifenthrin being the most abundant in Brazilian samples, λ-cyhalothrin in 
      Colombian and permethrin in Spanish ones. When the pyrethroid concentrations were 
      confronted against the number of gestations, an exponential decay was observed. 
      Moreover, a time trend study was carried out in Brazil, where additional archived 
      pool samples were analyzed, corresponding to years when pyrethroids were applied for 
      dengue epidemic control. In these cases, total pyrethroid levels reached up to 128 
      ng g⁻¹ lw, and concentrations decreased when massive use was not allowed. Finally, 
      daily intake estimation of nursing infants was calculated in each country and 
      compared to acceptable WHO levels. The estimated daily intakes for nursing infants 
      were always below the acceptable daily intake levels, nevertheless in certain 
      samples the detected concentrations were very close to the maximum acceptable 
      levels.

      world population continues to be plagued with one or more mosquito-vectored 
      diseases. These include malaria and filariasis as well as numerous 
      arboviral-associated illnesses including Dengue and Yellow fevers. The dynamics of 
      disease transmission by mosquitoes is complex, and involves both vector competence 
      and vectorial capacity. One area of intensive effort is the study of 
      chemosensory-driven behaviours in the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae 
      Giles, the modulation of which are likely to provide opportunities for disease 
      reduction. In this context recent studies have characterized a large divergent 
      family of An. gambiae odorant receptors (AgORs) that play critical roles in 
      olfactory signal transduction. This work has facilitated high-throughput, cell-based 
      calcium mobilization screens of AgOR-expressing HEK cells that have identified a 
      large number of conventional AgOR ligands, as well as the first non-conventional 
      Orco (olfactory receptor co-receptor) family agonist. As such, ligand-mediated 
      modulation serves as a proof-of-concept demonstration that AgORs represent viable 
      targets for high-throughput screening and for the eventual development of 
      behaviour-modifying olfactory compounds. Such attractants or repellents could foster 
      malaria reduction programmes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing use of point of care diagnostic tests that exclude 
      malaria, coupled with a declining malaria burden in many endemic countries, is 
      highlighting the lack of ability of many health systems to manage other causes of 
      febrile disease. A lack of knowledge of distribution of these pathogens, and a lack 
      of screening and point-of-care diagnostics to identify them, prevents effective 
      management of these generally treatable contributors to disease burden. While 
      prospective data collection is vital, an untapped body of knowledge already exists 
      in the published health literature. METHODS: Focusing on the Mekong region of 
      Southeast Asia, published data from 1986 to 2011 was screened to for frequency of 
      isolation of pathogens implicated in aetiology of non-malarial febrile illness. 
      Eligibility criteria included English-language peer-reviewed studies recording major 
      pathogens for which specific management is likely to be warranted. Of 1,252 
      identified papers, 146 met inclusion criteria and were analyzed and data mapped. 
      RESULTS: Data tended to be clustered around specific areas where research 
      institutions operate, and where resources to conduct studies are greater. The most 
      frequently reported pathogen was dengue virus (n = 70), followed by Orientia 
      tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia species (scrub typhus/murine typhus/spotted fever group 
      n = 58), Leptospira spp. (n = 35), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Paratyphi 
      (enteric fever n = 24), Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis n = 14), and Japanese 
      encephalitis virus (n = 18). Wide tracts with very little published data on 
      aetiology of fever are apparent. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This mapping 
      demonstrates a very heterogeneous distribution of information on the causes of fever 
      in the Mekong countries. Further directed data collection to address gaps in the 
      evidence-base, and expansion to a global database of pathogen distribution, is 
      readily achievable, and would help define wider priorities for research and 
      development to improve syndromic management of fever, prioritize diagnostic 
      development, and guide empirical therapy.

TI  - Media scanning and verification system as a supplemental tool to disease outbreak 
      detection & reporting at National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi.
PG  - 9-14
AB  - Media scanning for unusual health events can efficiently supplement conventional 
      communicable disease surveillance systems for early detection and response to 
      outbreaks. There is a need to rapidly process and appropriately disseminate the 
      media reports on unusual health events for timely action. Hence to address this need 
      in India a Media Scanning & Verification Cell (MSVC) was established in July 2008 at 
      the National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi. MSVC is supervised by 
      Epidemiologists working in Central Surveillance Unit of IDSP. This unique system 
      monitors Global and National Media sources such as National and Regional print 
      media, news on internet, news wires and websites, news channels and news shared by 
      partners like Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), Canada, WHO and 
      other International and national agencies. The information is shared to the 
      districts affected and District Surveillance Officer (DSO) and his team is expected 
      to investigate and revert through the internet about the correctness and action 
      taken. A mean number of 4 Media Alert reports are generated each day. A total of 
      1685 alerts were reported in a period between July 2008 to December 2011. Of these 
      1241 (73.7%) were verified as real events and 183 (10.9%) were considered outbreaks 
      by local health officials. Most events were captured through internet (57%) followed 
      by the print media (24%). The most common disease events identified were food-borne 
      and diarrhea (29.1%), dengue (10.68%), influenza & respiratory disease (8.1%) and 
      malaria (7.4%). The sensitivity of MSVC to detect outbreaks was 14.8% with more than 
      half of outbreaks detected before they were identified by the conventional 
      surveillance system. It has proven to be a highly effective supplemental tool to 
      official surveillance system in the detection of early warning signals and hence 
      timely detection and management of public health threats in India.

TI  - First report on susceptibility of wild Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) using 
      Carapa guianensis (Meliaceae) and Copaifera sp. (Leguminosae).
PG  - 699-705
LID - 10.1007/s00436-011-2545-7 [doi]
AB  - Oils of Carapa guianensis and Copaifera spp. are well known in the Amazonian region 
      as natural insect repellent, and studies have reported their efficiency as larvicide 
      against some laboratory mosquito species. However, in wild populations of 
      mosquitoes, these oils have not yet been evaluated. Thus, the objective of this 
      study was to investigate their efficiency as larvicide in wild populations of Aedes 
      aegypti with a history of exposure to organophosphate. The susceptibility of larvae 
      was determined under three different temperatures, 15°C, 20°C, and 30°C. For each 
      test, 1,000 larvae were used (late third instar and early fourth instar-four 
      replicates of 25 larvae per concentration). Statistical tests were used to identify 
      significant differences. The results demonstrated that as the laboratory A. aegypti, 
      the wild populations of A. aegypti were also susceptible to C. guianensis and 
      Copaifera sp. oils. The lethal concentrations for Copaifera sp. ranged from LC(50) 
      47 to LC(90) 91 (milligrams per liter), and for C. guianensis, they were LC(50) 136 
      to LC(90) 551 (milligrams per liter). In relation to different temperature, the 
      effectiveness of the oils on larvae mortality was directly related to the increase 
      of temperature, and better results were observed for temperature at 25°C. The 
      results presented here indicate the potential larvicidal activity of C. guianensis 
      and species of Copaifera, in populations of A. aegypti from the wild. Therefore, the 
      results presented here are very important since such populations are primarily 
      responsible for transmitting the dengue virus in the environment.

TI  - Expression of plasmid-based shRNA against the E1 and nsP1 genes effectively silenced 
      Chikungunya virus replication.
PG  - e46396

LID - e46396
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging alphavirus that causes 
      chikungunya fever and persistent arthralgia in humans. Currently, there is no 
      effective vaccine or antiviral against CHIKV infection. Therefore, this study 
      evaluates whether RNA interference which targets at viral genomic level may be a 
      novel antiviral strategy to inhibit the medically important CHIKV infection. 
      METHODS: Plasmid-based small hairpin RNA (shRNA) was investigated for its efficacy 
      in inhibiting CHIKV replication. Three shRNAs designed against CHIKV Capsid, E1 and 
      nsP1 genes were transfected to establish stable shRNA-expressing cell clones. 
      Following infection of stable shRNA cells clones with CHIKV at M.O.I. 1, viral 
      plaque assay, Western blotting and transmission electron microscopy were performed. 
      The in vivo efficacy of shRNA against CHIKV replication was also evaluated in a 
      suckling murine model of CHIKV infection. RESULTS: Cell clones expressing shRNAs 
      against CHIKV E1 and nsP1 genes displayed significant inhibition of infectious CHIKV 
      production, while shRNA Capsid demonstrated a modest inhibitory effect as compared 
      to scrambled shRNA cell clones and non-transfected cell controls. Western blot 
      analysis of CHIKV E2 protein expression and transmission electron microscopy of 
      shRNA E1 and nsP1 cell clones collectively demonstrated similar inhibitory trends 
      against CHIKV replication. shRNA E1 showed non cell-type specific anti-CHIKV effects 
      and broad-spectrum silencing against different geographical strains of CHIKV. 
      Furthermore, shRNA E1 clones did not exert any inhibition against Dengue virus and 
      Sindbis virus replication, thus indicating the high specificity of shRNA against 
      CHIKV replication. Moreover, no shRNA-resistant CHIKV mutant was generated after 50 
      passages of CHIKV in the stable cell clones. More importantly, strong and sustained 
      anti-CHIKV protection was conferred in suckling mice pre-treated with shRNA E1. 
      CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data suggest the promising efficacy of anti-CHIKV 
      shRNAs, in particular, plasmid-shRNA E1, as a novel antiviral strategy against CHIKV 
      infection.

AB  - Mosquitoes are blood-feeding insects and serve as the most important vectors for 
      spreading human diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, and 
      filariasis. The continued use of synthetic insecticides has resulted in resistance 
      in mosquitoes. Synthetic insecticides are toxic and affect the environment by 
      contaminating soil, water, and air, and then natural products may be an alternative 
      to synthetic insecticides because they are effective, biodegradable, eco-friendly, 
      and safe to environment. Botanical origin may serve as suitable alternative 
      biocontrol techniques in the future. Mentha spicata, an edible and medicinal plant, 
      is chiefly distributed in Southeast Asia and South Asia. In the present study, the 
      toxicity of mosquito larvicidal activity of leaf essential oil (EO) and their major 
      chemical constituents from Mentha spicata against Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes 
      aegypti, and Anopheles stephensi. The chemical composition of the leaf EO was 
      analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). GC-MS revealed that the 
      EO of M. spicata contained 18 compounds. The major chemical components identified 
      were carvone (48.60%), cis-carveol (21.30%), and limonene (11.30%). The EO had a 
      significant toxic effect against early third-stage larvae of C. quinquefasciatus, A. 
      aegypti, and A. stephensi with LC(50) values of 62.62, 56.08, and 49.71 ppm and 
      LC(90) values of 118.70, 110.28, and 100.99 ppm, respectively. The three major pure 
      constituents extracted from the M. spicata leaf EO were also tested individually 
      against three mosquito larvae. The LC(50) values of carvone, cis-carveol, and 
      limonene appeared to be most effective against A. stephensi (LC(50) 19.33, 28.50, 
      and 8.83 ppm) followed by A. aegypti (LC(50) 23.69, 32.88, and 12.01 ppm), and C. 
      quinquefasciatus (LC(50) 25.47, 35.20, and 14.07 ppm). The results could be useful 
      in search for newer, safer, and more effective natural larvicidal agents against C. 
      quinquefasciatus, A. aegypti, and A. stephensi.

AB  - Suspicion of Brazilian spotted fever (BSF) should occur in endemic regions upon 
      surveillance of the acute febrile icteric hemorrhagic syndrome (AFIHS). However, 
      limitations associated with currently available laboratory tests pose a challenge to 
      early diagnosis, especially in fatal cases. Two real-time PCR (qPCR) protocols were 
      evaluated to diagnose BSF in 110 fatal AFIHS cases, collected in BSF-endemic regions 
      in 2009-2010. Of these, 24 were positive and 86 negative by indirect 
      immunofluorescence (IFA) assay (cut-off IgG and/or IgM ≥ 128). DNA from these 
      samples was used in the qPCR protocols: one to detect Rickettsia spp. (citrate 
      synthase gene) and another to determine spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia species 
      (OmpA gene). Of the 24 IFA-positive samples, 5 (21%) were positive for OmpA and 9 
      (38%) for citrate synthase. In the IFA-negative group (n=86), OmpA and citrate 
      synthase were positive in 23 (27%) and 27 (31%), respectively. These results showed 
      that the 2 qPCR protocols were about twice as sensitive as the IFA test alone (93% 
      concordance). In conclusion, qPCR is a sensitive method for the diagnosis of fatal 
      BSF cases and should be considered for routine surveillance of AFIHS in places like 
      Brazil, where spotted fever-related lethality is high and other endemic diseases 
      like dengue and leptospirosis can mislead diagnosis.

TI  - Development, screening, and analysis of DNA aptamer libraries potentially useful for 
      diagnosis and passive immunity of arboviruses.
PG  - 633
LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-5-633 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid aptamers have long demonstrated the capacity to bind viral 
      envelope proteins and to inhibit the progression of pathogenic virus infections. 
      Here we report on initial efforts to develop and screen DNA aptamers against 
      recombinant envelope proteins or synthetic peptides and whole inactivated viruses 
      from several virulent arboviruses including Chikungunya, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic 
      fever (CCHF), dengue, tickborne encephalitis and West Nile viruses. We also analyzed 
      sequence data and secondary structures for commonalities that might reveal consensus 
      binding sites among the various aptamers. Some of the highest affinity and most 
      specific aptamers in the down-selected libraries were demonstrated to have 
      diagnostic utility in lateral flow chromatographic assays and in a fluorescent 
      aptamer-magnetic bead sandwich assay. Some of the reported aptamers may also be able 
      to bind viral envelope proteins in vivo and therefore may have antiviral potential 
      in passive immunity or prophylactic applications. RESULTS: Several arbovirus DNA 
      aptamer sequences emerged multiple times in the various down selected aptamer 
      libraries thereby suggesting some consensus sequences for binding arbovirus envelope 
      proteins. Screening of aptamers by enzyme-linked aptamer sorbent assay (ELASA) was 
      useful for ranking relative aptamer affinities against their cognate viral targets. 
      Additional study of the aptamer sequences and secondary structures of top-ranked 
      anti-arboviral aptamers suggest potential virus binding motifs exist within some of 
      the key aptamers and are highlighted in the supplemental figures for this article. 
      One sequence segment (ACGGGTCCGGACA) emerged 60 times in the anti-CCHF aptamer 
      library, but nowhere else in the anti-arbovirus library and only a few other times 
      in a larger library of aptamers known to bind bacteria and rickettsia or other 
      targets. Diagnostic utility of some of the aptamers for arbovirus detection in 
      lateral flow chromatographic assays and a fluorescent sandwich assay on the surface 
      of magnetic microbeads is also demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: This article catalogues 
      numerous DNA aptamer sequences which can bind various important pathogenic 
      arboviruses and have, in some cases, already demonstrated diagnostic potential. 
      These aptamer sequences are proprietary, patent-pending, and partially 
      characterized. Therefore, they are offered to the scientific community for potential 
      research use in diagnostic assays, biosensor applications or for possible passive 
      immunity and prophylaxis against pathogenic viruses.

TI  - Larvicidal, pupicidal, repellent and adulticidal activity of Citrus sinensis orange 
      peel extract against Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus 
      (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 1757-69
AB  - Mosquitoes are the carriers of severe and well-known illnesses such as malaria, 
      arboviral encephalitis, dengue fever, chikunguniya fever, West Nile virus and yellow 
      fever. These diseases produce significant morbidity and mortality in humans and 
      livestock around the world. The present study explored the effects of orange peel 
      ethanol extract of Citrus sinensis on larvicidal, pupicidal, repellent and 
      adulticidal activity against Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex 
      quinquefasciatus. The orange peel material was shade dried at room temperature and 
      powdered coarsely. From orange peel, 300 g powdered was macerated with 1 L of 
      ethanol sequentially for a period of 72 h each and filtered. The yields of the 
      orange peel ethanol crude extract of C. sinensis 13.86 g, respectively. The extracts 
      were concentrated at reduced temperature on a rotary vacuum evaporator and stored at 
      a temperature of 4 °C. The larvicidal, pupicidal and adult mortality was observed 
      after 24 h of exposure; no mortality was observed in the control group. For C. 
      sinensis, the median lethal concentration values (LC(50)) observed for the 
      larvicidal and pupicidal activities against mosquito vector species A. stephensi 
      first to fourth larval instars and pupae were 182.24, 227.93, 291.69, 398.00 and 
      490.84 ppm; A. aegypti values were 92.27, 106.60, 204.87, 264.26, 342.45, 436.93 and 
      497.41 ppm; and C. quinquefasciatus values were 244.70, 324.04, 385.32, 452.78 and 
      530.97 ppm, respectively. The results of maximum repellent activity were observed at 
      450 ppm in ethanol extracts of C. sinensis and the mean complete protection time 
      ranged from 150 to 180 min was tested. The ethanol extract of C. sinensis showed 
      100% repellency in 150 min and showed complete protection in 90 min at 350 ppm 
      against A. stephensi, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus, respectively. The adult 
      mortality was found in ethanol extract of C. sinensis with the LC(50) and LC(90) 
      values of 272.19 and 457.14 ppm, A. stephensi; 289.62 and 494.88 ppm, A. aegypti; 
      and 320.38 and 524.57 ppm, respectively. These results suggest that the orange peel 
      extracts of C. sinensis have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly 
      approach for the control of the vector control programmes.

TI  - Larvicidal activity of Morinda citrifolia L. (Noni) (Family: Rubiaceae) leaf extract 
      against Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 1481-90
AB  - Morinda citrifolia leaf extract was tested for larvicidal activity against three 
      medically important mosquito vectors such as malarial vector Anopheles stephensi, 
      dengue vector Aedes aegypti, and filarial vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The plant 
      material was shade dried at room temperature and powdered coarsely. From the leaf, 
      1-kg powder was macerated with 3.0 L of hexane, chloroform, acetone, methanol, and 
      water sequentially for a period of 72 h each and filtered. The yield of extracts was 
      hexane (13.56 g), chloroform (15.21 g), acetone (12.85 g), methanol (14.76 g), and 
      water (12.92 g), respectively. The extracts were concentrated at reduced temperature 
      on a rotary vacuum evaporator and stored at a temperature of 4°C. The M. citrifolia 
      leaf extract at 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 ppm caused a significant mortality of 
      three mosquito species. Hexane, chloroform, acetone, and water caused moderate 
      considerable mortality; however, the highest larval mortality was methanolic 
      extract, observed in three mosquito vectors. The larval mortality was observed after 
      24-h exposure. No mortality was observed in the control. The third larvae of 
      Anopheles stephensi had values of LC(50) = 345.10, 324.26, 299.97, 261.96, and 
      284.59 ppm and LC(90) = 653.00, 626.58, 571.89, 505.06, and 549.51 ppm, 
      respectively. The Aedes aegypti had values of LC(50) = 361.75, 343.22, 315.40, 
      277.92, and 306.98 ppm and LC(90) = 687.39, 659.02, 611.35, 568.18, and 613.25 ppm, 
      respectively. The Culex quinquefasciatus had values of LC(50) = 382.96, 369.85, 
      344.34, 330.42, and 324.64 ppm and LC(90) = 726.18, 706.57, 669.28, 619.63, and 
      644.47 ppm, respectively. The results of the leaf extract of M. citrifolia are 
      promising as good larvicidal activity against the mosquito vector Anopheles 
      stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus. This is a new eco-friendly 
      approach for the control of vector control programs. Therefore, this study provides 
      first report on the larvicidal activities against three species of mosquito vectors 
      of this plant extracts from India.

TI  - Sri Lanka in global medical research: a scientific analysis of the Sri Lankan 
      research output during 2000-2009.
PG  - 121

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scientific research is an essential component in guiding improvements in 
      health systems. There are no studies examining the Sri Lankan medical research 
      output at international level. The present study evaluated the Sri Lankan research 
      performance in medicine as reflected by the research publications output between 
      years 2000-2009. METHODS: This study was based on Sri Lankan medical research 
      publication data, retrieved from the SciVerse Scopus® from January 2000 to December 
      2009. The process of article selection was as follows: Affiliation - 'Sri Lanka' or 
      'Ceylon', Publication year - 'January 2000 to December 2009' and Subject area - 
      'Life and Health Sciences'. The articles identified were classified according to 
      disease, medical speciality, institutions, major international collaborators, 
      authors and journals. RESULTS: Sri Lanka's cumulative medical publications output 
      between years 2000-2009 was 1,740 articles published in 160 different journals. The 
      average annual publication growth rate was 9.1%. Majority of the articles were 
      published in 'International' (n = 950, 54.6%) journals. Most articles were 
      descriptive studies (n = 611, 35.1%), letters (n-345, 19.8%) and case reports (n = 
      311, 17.9%). The articles were authored by 148 different Sri Lankan authors from 146 
      different institutions. The three most prolific local institutions were Universities 
      of; Colombo (n = 547), Kelaniya (n = 246) and Peradeniya (n = 222). Eighty four 
      countries were found to have published collaborative papers with Sri Lankan authors 
      during the last decade. UK was the largest collaborating partner (n = 263,

      The 1,740 publications were cited 9,708 times, with an average citation of 5.6 per 
      paper. The most cited paper had 203 citations, while there were 597 publications 
      with no citations. The Sri Lankan authors' contribution to the global medical 
      research output during the last decade was only 0.086%. CONCLUSION: The Sri Lankan 
      medical research output during the last decade is only a small fraction of the 
      global research output. There it is a necessity to setup an enabling environment for 
      research, with a proper vision, support, funds and training. In addition, 
      collaborations across the region need to be strengthened to face common regional 
      health challenges.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases with an economic impact create loss in commercial and labor 
      outputs, particularly in countries with tropical and subtropical climates. Mosquito 
      control is facing a threat because of the emergence of resistance to synthetic 
      insecticides. Extracts from plants may be alternative sources of mosquito control 
      agents because they constitute a rich source of bioactive compounds that are 
      biodegradable into nontoxic products and potentially suitable for use to control 
      mosquitoes. Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as suitable alternative 
      biocontrol techniques in the future. In view of the recently increased interest in 
      developing plant origin insecticides as an alternative to chemical insecticide, this 
      study was undertaken to assess the larvicidal and ovicidal potential of the crude 
      hexane, benzene, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol solvent extracts from the 
      medicinal plant Delonix elata against the medically important mosquito vectors, 
      Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae). The larval mortality was 
      observed after 24 h of exposure. All extracts showed moderate larvicidal effects; 
      however, the highest larval mortality was found in methanol extract of leaf of D. 
      elata against the larvae of A. stephensi and A. aegypti with the LC(50) and LC(90) 
      values being 93.59 and 111.83, and 163.69 and 202.77 ppm, respectively. Compared to 
      leaf extracts, seeds have low potency against two mosquitoes with the LC(50) and 
      LC(90) values being 115.28 and 139.04, and 225.07 and 273.03 ppm, respectively. The 
      mean percent hatchability of the eggs was observed after 48 h post-treatment. The 
      percent hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of extract and 
      directly proportional to the eggs. All the five solvent extracts showed moderate 
      ovicidal activity; however, the methanol extract showed the highest ovicidal 
      activity. One hundred percent mortality was observed at 300 ppm for leaf methanol 
      extract and 500 ppm for seed methanol extract of D. elata against A. stephensi and 
      A. aegypti, respectively. These results suggest that the leaf and seed extracts have 
      the potential to be used as an ideal ecofriendly approach for the control of 
      mosquitoes. This is the first report on the mosquito larvicidal and ovicidal 
      activities of the reported D. elata plant.

TI  - Preparation and evaluation of recombinant severe fever with thrombocytopenia 
      syndrome virus nucleocapsid protein for detection of total antibodies in human and 
      animal sera by double-antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
PG  - 372-7
LID - 10.1128/JCM.01319-11 [doi]
AB  - The recent emergence of the human infection confirmed to be caused by severe fever 
      with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) in China is of global concern. Safe 
      diagnostic immunoreagents for determination of human and animal seroprevalence in 
      epidemiological investigations are urgently needed. This paper describes the cloning 
      and expression of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SFTSV. An N-protein-based 
      double-antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system was set up 
      to detect the total antibodies in human and animal sera. We reasoned that as the 
      double-antigen sandwich ELISA detected total antibodies with a higher sensitivity 
      than traditional indirect ELISA, it could be used to detect SFTSV-specific 
      antibodies from different animal species. The serum neutralization test was used to 
      validate the performance of this ELISA system. All human and animal sera that tested 
      positive in the neutralization test were also positive in the sandwich ELISA, and 
      there was a high correlation between serum neutralizing titers and ELISA readings. 
      Cross-reactivity was evaluated, and the system was found to be highly specific to 
      SFTSV; all hantavirus- and dengue virus-confirmed patient samples were negative. 
      SFTSV-confirmed human and animal sera from both Anhui and Hubei Provinces in China 
      reacted with N protein in this ELISA, suggesting no major antigenic variation 
      between geographically disparate virus isolates and the suitability of this assay in 
      nationwide application. ELISA results showed that 3.6% of the human serum samples 
      and 47.7% of the animal field serum samples were positive for SFTSV antibodies, 
      indicating that SFTSV has circulated widely in China. This assay, which is simple to 
      operate, poses no biohazard risk, does not require sophisticated equipment, and can 
      be used in disease surveillance programs, particularly in the screening of large 
      numbers of samples from various animal species.

AB  - Mosquitoes are vectors of several major human diseases and their control is mainly 
      based on the use of chemical insecticides. Resistance of mosquitoes to 
      organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids led to a regain of 
      interest for the use of neonicotinoid insecticides in vector control. The present 
      study investigated the molecular basis of neonicotinoid resistance in the mosquito 
      Aedes aegypti. A strain susceptible to insecticides was selected at the larval stage 
      with imidacloprid. After eight generations of selection, larvae of the selected 
      strain (Imida-R) showed a 5.4-fold increased tolerance to imidacloprid while adult 
      tolerance level remained low. Imida-R larvae showed significant cross-tolerance to 
      other neonicotinoids but not to pyrethroids, organophosphates and carbamates. 
      Transcriptome profiling identified 344 and 108 genes differentially transcribed in 
      larvae and adults of the Imida-R strain compared to the parental strain. Most of 
      these genes encode detoxification enzymes, cuticle proteins, hexamerins as well as 
      other proteins involved in cell metabolism. Among detoxification enzymes, cytochrome 
      P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) and glucosyl/glucuronosyl transferases (UDPGTs) were 
      over-represented. Bioassays with enzyme inhibitors and biochemical assays confirmed 
      the contribution of P450s with an increased capacity of the Imida-R microsomes to 
      metabolize imidacloprid in presence of NADPH. Comparison of substrate recognition 
      sites and imidacloprid docking models of six CYP6s over-transcribed in the Imida-R 
      strain together with Bemisia tabaci CYP6CM1vQ and Drosophila melanogaster CYP6G1, 
      both able to metabolize imidacloprid, suggested that CYP6BB2 and CYP6N12 are good 
      candidates for imidacloprid metabolism in Ae. aegypti. The present study revealed 
      that imidacloprid tolerance in mosquitoes can arise after few generations of 
      selection at the larval stage but does not lead to a significant tolerance of 
      adults. As in other insects, P450-mediated insecticide metabolism appears to play a 
      major role in imidacloprid tolerance in mosquitoes.

TI  - Co-inheritance of compound heterozygous Hb Constant Spring and a single -alpha(3.7) 
      gene deletion with heterozygous deltabeta thalassaemia: a diagnostic challenge.
PG  - 57-62
AB  - Haemoglobin Constant Spring (Hb CS) mutation and single gene deletions are common 
      underlying genetic abnormalities for alpha thalassaemias. Co-inheritance of 
      deletional and non-deletional alpha (alpha) thalassaemias may result in various 
      thalassaemia syndromes. Concomitant co-inheritance with beta (beta) and delta 
      (delta) gene abnormalities would result in improved clinical phenotype. We report 
      here a 33-year-old male patient who was admitted with dengue haemorrhagic fever, 
      with a background history of Grave's disease, incidentally noted to have mild 
      hypochromic microcytic red cell indices. Physical examination revealed no 
      thalassaemic features or hepatosplenomegaly. His full blood picture showed 
      hypochromic microcytic red cells with normal haemoglobin (Hb) level. Quantitation of 
      Hb using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis 
      (CE) revealed raised Hb F, normal Hb A2 and Hb A levels. There was also small peak 
      of Hb CS noted in CE. H inclusions was negative. Kleihauer test was positive with 
      heterocellular distribution of Hb F among the red cells. DNA analysis for alpha 
      globin gene mutations showed a single -alpha(-3.7) deletion and Hb CS mutation. 
      These findings were suggestive of compound heterozygosity of Hb CS and a single 
      -alpha(-3.7) deletion with a concomitant heterozygous deltabeta thalassaemia. 
      Co-inheritance of Hb CS and a single -alpha(-3.7) deletion is expected to result at 
      the very least in a clinical phenotype similar to that of two alpha genes deletion. 
      However we demonstrate here a phenotypic modification of alpha thalassemia 
      presumptively as a result of co-inheritance with deltabeta chain abnormality as 
      suggested by the high Hb F level.

TI  - The antioxidant role of xanthurenic acid in the Aedes aegypti midgut during 
      digestion of a blood meal.

AB  - In the midgut of the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a vector of dengue and yellow fever, an 
      intense release of heme and iron takes place during the digestion of a blood meal. 
      Here, we demonstrated via chromatography, light absorption and mass spectrometry 
      that xanthurenic acid (XA), a product of the oxidative metabolism of tryptophan, is 
      produced in the digestive apparatus after the ingestion of a blood meal and reaches 
      milimolar levels after 24 h, the period of maximal digestive activity. XA formation 
      does not occur in the White Eye (WE) strain, which lacks kynurenine hydroxylase and 
      accumulates kynurenic acid. The formation of XA can be diminished by feeding the 
      insect with 3,4-dimethoxy-N-[4-(3-nitrophenyl)thiazol-2-yl] benzenesulfonamide 
      (Ro-61-8048), an inhibitor of XA biosynthesis. Moreover, XA inhibits the 
      phospholipid oxidation induced by heme or iron. A major fraction of this antioxidant 
      activity is due to the capacity of XA to bind both heme and iron, which occurs at a 
      slightly alkaline pH (7.5-8.0), a condition found in the insect midgut. The midgut 
      epithelial cells of the WE mosquito has a marked increase in occurrence of cell 
      death, which is reversed to levels similar to the wild type mosquitoes by feeding 
      the insects with blood supplemented with XA, confirming the protective role of this 
      molecule. Collectively, these results suggest a new role for XA as a heme and iron 
      chelator that provides protection as an antioxidant and may help these animals adapt 
      to a blood feeding habit.

TI  - Effect of Moringa oleifera flower extract on larval trypsin and acetylcholinesterase 
      activities in Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 135-52

AB  - Aedes aegypti control is crucial to reducing dengue fever. Aedes aegypti larvae have 
      developed resistance to organophosporous insecticides and the use of natural 
      larvicides may help manage larval resistance by increasing elements in insecticide 
      rotation programs. Here, we report on larvicidal activity of Moringa oleifera flower 
      extract against A. aegypti L(1), L(2), L(3), and L(4) as well as the effect of 
      flower extract on gut trypsin and whole-larval acetylcholinesterase from L(4.) In 
      addition, the heated flower extract was investigated for larvicidal activity against 
      L(4) and effect on larval gut trypsin. Moringa oleifera flower extract contains a 
      proteinaceous trypsin inhibitor (M. oleifera flower trypsin inhibitor, MoFTI), 
      triterpene (β-amyrin), sterol (β-sitosterol) as well as flavonoids (kaempferol and 
      quercetin). Larvicidal activity was detected against L(2), L(3), and L(4) (LC(50) of 
      1.72%, 1.67%, and 0.92%, respectively). Flower extract inhibited L(4) gut trypsin 
      (MoFTI K(i) = 0.6 nM) and did not affect acetylcholinesterase activity. In vivo 
      assay showed that gut trypsin activity from L(4) treated with M. oleifera flower 
      extract decreased over time (0-1,440 min) and was strongly inhibited (98.6%) after 
      310 min incubation; acetylcholinesterase activity was not affected. Thermal 
      treatment resulted in a loss of trypsin inhibitor and larvicidal activities, 
      supporting the hypothesis that flower extract contains a proteinaceous trypsin 
      inhibitor that may be responsible for the deleterious effects on larval mortality.

TI  - A computational tool for the design of live attenuated virus vaccine based on 
      microRNA-mediated gene silencing.
PG  - S15
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-13-S7-S15 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microRNA-based gene-silencing machinery has been recognized as a 
      promising approach to control viral replication and used for improving safety for 
      the live attenuated virus vaccines. The effective host microRNA response elements 
      (MREs) have been incorporated into a virus sequence mainly based on the experimental 
      trials for identifying both microRNA binding sites and effective mutations. The 
      design of MREs for viral genomes or with multiple host microRNAs of interest, then, 
      will be time and cost consuming. RESULTS: In this paper, we introduced a 
      computational flow that could be used to design MREs of human microRNAs within 
      Influenza A H1N1 virus gene segments. The main steps of the flow includes locating 
      possible binding sites; MREs, of human microRNAs within the viral sequences using a 
      miRNA target prediction tool (miranda), performing various mutations among 
      mismatched binding positions, calculating the binding energy, score, identity, and 
      the effects of changed physical properties of amino acids according to the changed 
      bases in RNA level, and prioritizing the mutated binding sites. The top ranked MREs 
      of human microRNA hsa-miR-93 is consistent with previous literature while other 
      results waited to be experimentally verified. To make the computational flow easily 
      accessible by virologists, we also developed MicroLive, a web server version of the 
      MRE design flow together with the database of miranda-predicted MREs within gene 
      sequences of seven RNA viruses including Influenza A, dengue, hepatitis C, measles, 
      mumps, poliovirus, and rabies. Users may design MREs of specific human microRNAs for 
      their input viral sequences using MRE design tool or optimize the miranda-predicted 
      MREs of seven viruses available on the system. Also, users could design varied 
      number of MREs for multiple human microRNAs to modulate the degree of live vaccine 
      attenuation and reduce the likelihood of escape mutants. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      computational design of MREs helps reduce time and cost for experimental trials. 
      While the flow was demonstrated using human microRNAs and Influenza A H1N1 virus, it 
      could be flexibly applied to other hosts (e.g., animals) and viruses of interest for 
      constructing host-specific live attenuated vaccines. Also, it could be deployed for 
      engineering tissue-specific oncolytic viruses in cancer virotherapeutics. The 
      MicroLive web server is freely accessible at http://www.biotec.or.th/isl/microlive.

AB  - Mosquitoes are insect vectors responsible for the transmission of parasitic and 
      viral infections to millions of people worldwide, with substantial morbidity and 
      mortality. Infections transmitted by mosquitoes include malaria, yellow fever, 
      chikungunya, filariasis and other arboviruses. Insecticides of botanical origin may 
      serve as suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. The adulticidal 
      activities of crude hexane, benzene, ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol leaf 
      extracts of Acalypha alnifolia were assayed for their toxicity against three 
      important vector mosquitoes, viz., Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex 
      quinquefasciatus. The adult mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure. All 
      extracts showed moderate adulticide effects; however, the highest adult mortality 
      was found in methanol extract were observed. The LC(50) values of A. alnifolia leaf 
      extracts against adulticidal activity of (hexane, benzene, ethyl acetate, acetone 
      and methanol) A. aegypti, A. stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus were the following: 
      A. aegypti values were 371.87, 342.97, 320.17, 300.86 and 279.75 ppm; A. stephensi 
      values were 358.35, 336.64, 306.10, 293.01 and 274.76 ppm; C. quinquefasciatus 
      values were 383.59, 354.13, 327.74, 314.33 and 291.71 ppm. The results of the 
      repellent activity of hexane, benzene, ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol extract 
      of A. alnifolia plant at three different concentrations of 1.0, 3.0, and 
      5.0 mg/cm(2) were applied on skin of forearm in man and exposed against adult female 
      mosquitoes. In this observation, this plant crude extracts gave protection against 
      mosquito bites without any allergic reaction to the test person, and also, the 
      repellent activity is dependent on the strength of the plant extracts. Mean percent 
      hatchability of the ovicidal activity was observed 48 h post-treatment. The percent 
      hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of extract and directly 
      proportional to the eggs. Mortality of 100 % with methanol extract of A. alnifolia 
      was exerted at 125 and 300 ppm. The larval density was decreased after the treatment 
      of plant extracts at the breeding sites (water bodies system) of vector mosquitoes, 
      and hence, these plant extracts are suitable alternatives of synthetic insecticides 
      for mosquito vector management.These results suggest that the leaf solvent plant 
      extracts have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the 
      control of mosquitoes. This study provides first report on the mosquito ovicidal, 
      repellent and adulticidal activities of these plant extracts against mosquito vector 
      species from India.

TI  - Larval ecology of mosquitoes in sylvatic arbovirus foci in southeastern Senegal.
PG  - 286
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although adult mosquito vectors of sylvatic arbovirus [yellow fever 
      (YFV), dengue-2 (DENV-2) and chikungunya (CHIKV)] have been studied for the past 40 
      years in southeastern Senegal, data are still lacking on the ecology of larval 
      mosquitoes in this area. In this study, we investigated the larval habitats of 
      mosquitoes and characterized their seasonal and spatial dynamics in arbovirus foci. 
      METHODS: We searched for wet microhabitats, classified in 9 categories, in five land 
      cover classes (agriculture, forest, savannah, barren and village) from June, 2010 to 
      January, 2011. Mosquito immatures were sampled monthly in up to 30 microhabitats of 
      each category per land cover and bred until adult stage for determination. RESULTS: 
      No wet microhabitats were found in the agricultural sites; in the remaining land 
      covers immature stages of 35 mosquito species in 7 genera were sampled from 9 
      microhabitats (tree holes, fresh fruit husks, decaying fruit husks, puddles, bamboo 
      holes, discarded containers, tires, rock holes and storage containers). The most 
      abundant species was Aedes aegypti formosus, representing 30.2% of the collections, 
      followed by 12 species, representing each more than 1% of the total, among them the 
      arbovirus vectors Ae. vittatus (7.9%), Ae. luteocephalus (5.7%), Ae. taylori (5.0%), 
      and Ae. furcifer (1.3%). Aedes aegypti, Cx. nebulosus, Cx. perfuscus, Cx. 
      tritaeniorhynchus, Er. chrysogster and Ae. vittatus were the only common species 
      collected from all land covers. Aedes furcifer and Ae. taylori were collected in 
      fresh fruit husks and tree holes. Species richness and dominance varied 
      significantly in land covers and microhabitats. Positive associations were found 
      mainly between Ae. furcifer, Ae. taylori and Ae. luteocephalus. A high proportion of 
      potential enzootic vectors that are not anthropophilic were found in the larval 
      mosquito fauna. CONCLUSIONS: In southeastern Senegal, Ae. furcifer and Ae. taylori 
      larvae showed a more limited distribution among both land cover and microhabitat 
      types than the other common species. Uniquely among vector species, Ae. aegypti 
      formosus larvae occurred at the highest frequency in villages. Finally, a high 
      proportion of the potential non-anthropophilic vectors were represented in the 
      larval mosquito fauna, suggesting the existence of unidentified sylvatic arbovirus 
      cycles in southeastern Senegal.

TI  - Single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the CD209 gene is 
      associated with human predisposition to severe forms of tick-borne encephalitis.
PG  - 64-8
LID - 10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.10.017 [doi]
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a neurotropic, positive-sense RNA virus of 
      the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) which can cause a variety of clinical 
      manifestations in humans. Previously the severity and outcome of dengue fever and 
      hepatitis C (diseases caused by viruses from the family Flaviviridae) were 
      associated with the rs4804803 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the 
      promoter region of the human CD209 gene. This gene encodes dendritic cell-specific 
      ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), a C-type lectin pathogen-recognition receptor 
      expressed on the surface of dendritic cells and some types of macrophages. In the 
      current study, a possible association between two SNPs in the promoter region of the 
      CD209 gene (rs4804803 and rs2287886) and predisposition to severe forms of 
      TBEV-induced disease was investigated. The genotypic, allelic and haplotypic 
      frequencies of these SNPs were analyzed in 136 non-immunized Russian patients with 
      different clinical manifestations of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and in a control 
      group. An increase in the frequency of the rs2287886 SNP AA homozygotes and the A 
      allele was detected among patients with severe central nervous system disease 
      compared with the group of patients with meningitis (P=0.003 and 0.019), or a 
      combined group of patients with mild forms (fever and meningitis) (P=0.003 and 
      0.026), or the control group (P=0.007 and 0.035). Thus, our results suggest that the 
      CD209 gene promoter region rs2287886 SNP is associated with predisposition to severe 
      forms of TBE in the Russian population.

TI  - Dephosphorylation of HuR protein during alphavirus infection is associated with HuR 
      relocalization to the cytoplasm.
PG  - 36229-38

AB  - We have demonstrated previously that the cellular HuR protein binds U-rich elements 
      in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Sindbis virus RNA and relocalizes from the 
      nucleus to the cytoplasm upon Sindbis virus infection in 293T cells. In this study, 
      we show that two alphaviruses, Ross River virus and Chikungunya virus, lack the 
      conserved high-affinity U-rich HuR binding element in their 3' UTRs but still 
      maintain the ability to interact with HuR with nanomolar affinities through 
      alternative binding elements. The relocalization of HuR protein occurs during 
      Sindbis infection of multiple mammalian cell types as well as during infections with 
      three other alphaviruses. Interestingly, the relocalization of HuR is not a general 
      cellular reaction to viral infection, as HuR protein remained largely nuclear during 
      infections with dengue and measles virus. Relocalization of HuR in a Sindbis 
      infection required viral gene expression, was independent of the presence of a 
      high-affinity U-rich HuR binding site in the 3' UTR of the virus, and was associated 
      with an alteration in the phosphorylation state of HuR. Sindbis virus-induced HuR 
      relocalization was mechanistically distinct from the movement of HuR observed during 
      a cellular stress response, as there was no accumulation of caspase-mediated HuR 
      cleavage products. Collectively, these data indicate that virus-induced HuR 
      relocalization to the cytoplasm is specific to alphavirus infections and is 
      associated with distinct posttranslational modifications of this RNA-binding 
      protein.

TI  - Web-based GIS: the vector-borne disease airline importation risk (VBD-AIR) tool.
PG  - 33
LID - 10.1186/1476-072X-11-33 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past century, the size and complexity of the air travel network 
      has increased dramatically. Nowadays, there are 29.6 million scheduled flights per 
      year and around 2.7 billion passengers are transported annually. The rapid expansion 
      of the network increasingly connects regions of endemic vector-borne disease with 
      the rest of the world, resulting in challenges to health systems worldwide in terms 
      of vector-borne pathogen importation and disease vector invasion events. Here we 
      describe the development of a user-friendly Web-based GIS tool: the Vector-Borne 
      Disease Airline Importation Risk Tool (VBD-AIR), to help better define the roles of 
      airports and airlines in the transmission and spread of vector-borne diseases. 
      METHODS: Spatial datasets on modeled global disease and vector distributions, as 
      well as climatic and air network traffic data were assembled. These were combined to 
      derive relative risk metrics via air travel for imported infections, imported 
      vectors and onward transmission, and incorporated into a three-tier server 
      architecture in a Model-View-Controller framework with distributed GIS components. A 
      user-friendly web-portal was built that enables dynamic querying of the spatial 
      databases to provide relevant information. RESULTS: The VBD-AIR tool constructed 
      enables the user to explore the interrelationships among modeled global 
      distributions of vector-borne infectious diseases (malaria. dengue, yellow fever and 
      chikungunya) and international air service routes to quantify seasonally changing 
      risks of vector and vector-borne disease importation and spread by air travel, 
      forming an evidence base to help plan mitigation strategies. The VBD-AIR tool is 
      available at http://www.vbd-air.com. CONCLUSIONS: VBD-AIR supports a data flow that 
      generates analytical results from disparate but complementary datasets into an 
      organized cartographical presentation on a web map for the assessment of 
      vector-borne disease movements on the air travel network. The framework built 
      provides a flexible and robust informatics infrastructure by separating the modules 
      of functionality through an ontological model for vector-borne disease. The VBD‒AIR 
      tool is designed as an evidence base for visualizing the risks of vector-borne 
      disease by air travel for a wide range of users, including planners and decisions 
      makers based in state and local government, and in particular, those at 
      international and domestic airports tasked with planning for health risks and 
      allocating limited resources.

TI  - Evidence for a genetic and physical interaction between nonstructural proteins NS1 
      and NS4B that modulates replication of West Nile virus.
PG  - 7360-71
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00157-12 [doi]
AB  - Flavivirus NS1 is a nonstructural glycoprotein that is expressed on the cell surface 
      and secreted into the extracellular space. Despite its transit through the secretory 
      pathway, NS1 is an essential gene linked to early viral RNA replication. How this 
      occurs has remained a mystery given the disparate localization of NS1 and the viral 
      RNA replication complex, as the latter is present on the cytosolic face of the 
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We recently identified an N-terminal di-amino acid motif 
      in NS1 that modulates protein targeting and affected viral replication. Exchange of 
      two amino acids at positions 10 and 11 from dengue virus (DENV) into West Nile virus 
      (WNV) NS1 (RQ10NK) changed its relative surface expression and secretion and 
      attenuated infectivity. However, the phenotype of WNV containing NS1 RQ10NK was 
      unstable, as within two passages heterogeneous plaque variants were observed. Here, 
      using a mutant WNV encoding the NS1 RQ10NK mutation, we identified a suppressor 
      mutation (F86C) in NS4B, a virally encoded transmembrane protein with loops on both 
      the luminal and cytoplasmic sides of the ER membrane. Introduction of NS4B F86C 
      specifically rescued RNA replication of mutant WNV but did not affect the wild-type 
      virus. Mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation studies established a novel 
      physical interaction between NS1 and NS4B, suggesting a mechanism for how luminal 
      NS1 conveys signals to the cytoplasm to regulate RNA replication.

TI  - Repellent effect of Salvia dorisiana, S. longifolia, and S. sclarea (Lamiaceae) 
      essential oils against the mosquito Aedes albopictus Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 291-9
LID - 10.1007/s00436-012-2837-6 [doi]
AB  - Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) has been one of the fastest spreading insects 
      over the past 20 years. Its medical importance is due to the aggressive daytime 
      human-biting behavior and the ability to vector many viruses, including dengue, 
      LaCrosse, Eastern Equine encephalitis and West Nile viruses. In this research, the 
      essential oils (EOs) extracted from fresh air dried leaves of Salvia dorisiana, S. 
      longifolia, and S. sclarea (Lamiaceae) were evaluated for their repellent activity 
      against A. albopictus by using the human-bait technique. The EOs chemical 
      composition was also investigated, and EOs were divided in three different profiles 
      on the basis of their chemical composition: EO with large amount of monoterpenes 
      from S. sclarea, EO rich in oxygenated sesquiterpenes from S. dorisiana, and S. 
      longifolia EO characterized by similar percentages of monoterpenes and 
      sesquiterpenes. The efficacy protection from S. dorisiana, S. longifolia, and S. 
      sclarea EOs, at dosages ranging from 0.004 to 0.4 μL cm(-2) of skin, was evaluated 
      during 120 min of observation. Results indicated that S. dorisiana, S. longifolia, 
      and S. sclarea EOs had a significant repellent activity (RD(50) =0.00035, 0.00049, 
      and 0.00101 μL cm(-2), respectively), with differences in repellency rates, as a 
      function of oil, dosage, and observation time. S. dorisiana was the most effective 
      oil: at the two higher dosages, it gave almost complete protection (with a 
      protective efficacy of 90.99% and 95.62%, respectively) for 90 min. The best 
      protection time was achieved with S. dorisiana essential oil. It ranged from 9.2 to 
      92.4 min. Protection times of S. longifolia and S. sclarea oils ranged from 3.2 to 
      60 min, and from 3.6 to 64.2 min, respectively. Our findings clearly reveal that 
      these EOs have a good repellent activity against A. albopictus, therefore they can 
      be proposed to improve the efficacy of repellent formulations against the Asian 
      tiger mosquito.

PG  - 505-10
LID - 10.1016/j.virol.2012.06.025 [doi]
AB  - The new generation broadly neutralizing antibody VRC01 against HIV-1 shows great 
      potential as a topically administered microbicide to prevent sexual transmission. We 
      evaluated its efficacy in a RAG-hu humanized mouse model of vaginal HIV-1 
      transmission. Mice were challenged vaginally with R5 tropic HIV-1 BaL an hour after 
      intravaginal application of the VRC01 (1 mg/ml concentration) gel. A combination of 
      four first generation bNAbs, namely b12, 2F5, 4E10 and 2G12, was used as a positive 
      efficacy control whereas a non-specific dengue MAb 4G2 was used as negative control. 
      Our results showed that seven out of nine VRC01 antibody administered mice and all 
      of the mice receiving the four bNAb antibody combination were protected against 
      HIV-1 challenge. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of the new bNAb VRC01 as a 
      topical microbicide to protect against HIV-1 vaginal transmission and highlight the 
      use of the RAG-hu mouse model for testing HIV prevention strategies.

AB  - The hepatitis C virus (HCV) multifunctional nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is a 
      protease that cleaves viral and host proteins and a helicase that separates DNA and 
      RNA structures in reactions fueled by ATP hydrolysis. Li et al. (2012) recently 
      synthesized a series of new NS3 helicase inhibitors from the benzothiazole dimer 
      component of the fluorescent yellow dye primuline. This study further characterizes 
      a subset of these primuline derivatives with respect to their specificity, mechanism 
      of action, and effect on cells harboring HCV subgenomic replicons. All compounds 
      inhibited DNA and RNA unwinding catalyzed by NS3 from different HCV genotypes, but 
      only some inhibited the NS3 protease function, and few had any effect on HCV NS3 
      catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. A different subset contained potent inhibitors of RNA 
      stimulated ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the related NS3 protein from Dengue virus. In 
      assays monitoring intrinsic protein fluorescence in the absence of nucleic acids, 
      the compounds cooperatively bound NS3 with K(d)s that reflect their potency in 
      assays. The fluorescent properties of the primuline derivatives both in vitro and in 
      cells are also described. The primuline derivative that was the most active against 
      subgenomic replicons in cells caused a 14-fold drop in HCV RNA levels 
      (IC(50)=5±2μM). In cells, the most effective primuline derivative did not inhibit 
      the cellular activity of NS3 protease but disrupted HCV replicase structures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the disease burden attributable to unsafe water and poor 
      sanitation and hygiene in China, to identify high-burden groups and to inform 
      improvement measures. METHODS: The disease burden attributable to unsafe water and 
      poor sanitation and hygiene in China was estimated for diseases resulting from 
      exposure to biologically contaminated soil and water (diarrhoeal disease, 
      helminthiases and schistosomiasis) and vector transmission resulting from inadequate 
      management of water resources (malaria, dengue and Japanese encephalitis). The data 
      were obtained from China's national infectious disease reporting system, national 
      helminthiasis surveys and national water and sanitation surveys. The fraction of 
      each health condition attributable to unsafe water and poor sanitation and hygiene 
      in China was estimated from data in the Chinese and international literature. 
      FINDINGS: In 2008, 327 million people in China lacked access to piped drinking water 
      and 535 million lacked access to improved sanitation. The same year, unsafe water 
      and poor sanitation and hygiene accounted for 2.81 million disability-adjusted life 
      years (DALYs) and 62,800 deaths in the country, and 83% of the attributable burden 
      was found in children less than 5 years old. Per capita DALYs increased along an 
      east-west gradient, with the highest burden in inland provinces having the lowest 
      income per capita. CONCLUSION: Despite remarkable progress, China still needs to 
      conduct infrastructural improvement projects targeting provinces that have 
      experienced slower economic development. Improved monitoring, increased regulatory 
      oversight and more government transparency are needed to better estimate the effects 
      of microbiologically and chemically contaminated water and poor sanitation and 
      hygiene on human health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited information exists on the epidemiology of acute febrile 
      respiratory illnesses in tropical South American countries such as Venezuela. The 
      objective of the present study was to examine the epidemiology of influenza-like 
      illness (ILI) in two hospitals in Maracay, Venezuela. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: We performed a prospective surveillance study of persons with ILI who 
      presented for care at two hospitals in Maracay, Venezuela, from October 2006 to 
      December 2010. A respiratory specimen and clinical information were obtained from 
      each participant. Viral isolation and identification with immunofluorescent 
      antibodies and molecular methods were employed to detect respiratory viruses such as 
      adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza, and respiratory sincytial virus, among 
      others. There were 916 participants in the study (median age: 17 years; range: 1 
      month--86 years). Viruses were identified in 143 (15.6%) subjects, and one 
      participant was found to have a co-infection with more than one virus. Influenza 
      viruses, including pandemic H1N1 2009, were the most frequently detected pathogens, 
      accounting for 67.4% (97/144) of the viruses detected. Adenovirus (15/144), 
      parainfluenza virus (13/144), and respiratory syncytial virus (11/144) were also 
      important causes of ILI in this study. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus became the most 
      commonly isolated influenza virus during its initial appearance in 2009. Two waves 
      of the pandemic were observed: the first which peaked in August 2009 and the 
      second--higher than the preceding - that peaked in October 2009. In 2010, influenza 
      A/H3N2 re-emerged as the most predominant respiratory virus detected. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Influenza viruses were the most commonly detected viral 
      organisms among patients with acute febrile respiratory illnesses presenting at two 
      hospitals in Maracay, Venezuela. Pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus did not 
      completely replace other circulating influenza viruses during its initial appearance 
      in 2009. Seasonal influenza A/H3N2 was the most common influenza virus in the 
      post-pandemic phase.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, 
      causes around 68,000 encephalitis cases annually, of which 20-30% are fatal, while 
      30-50% of the recovered cases develop severe neurological sequelae. Specific 
      antivirals for JEV would be of great importance, particularly in those cases where 
      the infection has become persistent. Being indispensable for flaviviral replication, 
      the NS2B-NS3 protease is a promising target for design of anti-flaviviral 
      inhibitors. Contrary to related flaviviral proteases, the JEV NS2B-NS3 protease is 
      structurally and mechanistically much less characterized. Here we aimed at 
      establishing a straightforward procedure for cloning, expression, purification and 
      biochemical characterization of JEV NS2B(H)-NS3pro protease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: The full-length sequence of JEV NS2B-NS3 genotype III strain JaOArS 982 
      was obtained as a synthetic gene. The sequence of NS2B(H)-NS3pro was generated by 
      splicing by overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) and cloned into the pTrcHisA vector. 
      Hexahistidine-tagged NS2B(H)-NS3pro, expressed in E. coli as soluble protein, was 
      purified to >95% purity by a single-step immobilized metal affinity chromatography. 
      SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the purified enzyme demonstrated NS2B(H)-NS3pro 
      precursor and its autocleavage products, NS3pro and NS2B(H), as 36, 21, and 10 kDa 
      bands, respectively. Kinetic parameters, K(m) and k(cat), for fluorogenic protease 
      model substrates, Boc-GRR-amc, Boc-LRR-amc, Ac-nKRR-amc, Bz-nKRR-amc, Pyr-RTKR-amc 
      and Abz-(R)(4)SAG-nY-amide, were obtained using inner filter effect correction. The 
      highest catalytic efficiency k(cat)/K(m) was found for Pyr-RTKR-amc (k(cat)/K(m): 
      1962.96 ± 85.0 M(-1) s(-1)) and the lowest for Boc-LRR-amc (k(cat)/K(m): 3.74±0.3 
      M(-1) s(-1)). JEV NS3pro is inhibited by aprotinin but to a lesser extent than DEN 
      and WNV NS3pro. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A simplified procedure for the cloning, 
      overexpression and purification of the NS2B(H)-NS3pro was established which is 
      generally applicable to other flaviviral proteases. Kinetic parameters obtained for 
      a number of model substrates and inhibitors, are useful for the characterization of 
      substrate specificity and eventually for the design of high-throughput assays aimed 
      at antiviral inhibitor discovery.

AB  - Flaviviruses cause a wide range of severe diseases ranging from encephalitis to 
      hemorrhagic fever. Discovery of host factors that regulate the fate of flaviviruses 
      in infected cells could provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of infection 
      and therefore facilitate the development of anti-flaviviral drugs. We performed 
      genome-scale siRNA screens to discover human host factors required for yellow fever 
      virus (YFV) propagation. Using a 2 × 2 siRNA pool screening format and a duplicate 
      of the screen, we identified a high confidence list of YFV host factors. To find 
      commonalities between flaviviruses, these candidates were compared to host factors 
      previously identified for West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV). This 
      comparison highlighted a potential requirement for the G protein-coupled receptor 
      kinase family, GRKs, for flaviviral infection. The YFV host candidate GRK2 (also 
      known as ADRBK1) was validated both in siRNA-mediated knockdown HuH-7 cells and in 
      GRK(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Additionally, we showed that GRK2 was required 
      for efficient propagation of DENV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) indicating that GRK2 
      requirement is conserved throughout the Flaviviridae. Finally, we found that GRK2 
      participates in multiple distinct steps of the flavivirus life cycle by promoting 
      both entry and RNA synthesis. Together, our findings identified GRK2 as a novel 
      regulator of flavivirus infection and suggest that inhibition of GRK2 function may 
      constitute a new approach for treatment of flavivirus associated diseases.

AB  - The orphan nuclear receptor HR3 is essential for developmental switches during 
      insect development and metamorphosis regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). 
      Reproduction of female mosquitoes of the major vector of Dengue fever, Aedes 
      aegypti, is cyclic because of its dependence on blood feeding. 20E is an important 
      hormone regulating vitellogenic events in this mosquito; however, any role for HR3 
      in 20E-driven reproductive events has not been known. Using RNA interference (RNAi) 
      approach, we demonstrated that Aedes HR3 plays a critical role in a timely 
      termination of expression of the vitellogenin (Vg) gene encoding the major yolk 
      protein precursor. It is also important for downregulation of the 
      Target-of-Rapamycin pathway and activation of programmed autophagy in the Aedes fat 
      body at the end of vitellogenesis. HR3 is critical in activating betaFTZ-F1, EcRB 
      and USPA, the expressions of which are highly elevated at the end of vitellogenesis. 
      RNAi depletion of HR3 (iHR3) prior to the first gonadotrophic cycle affects a normal 
      progression of the second gonadotrophic cycle. Most of ovaries 24 h post second 
      blood meal from iHR3 females in the second cycle were small with follicles that were 
      only slightly different in length from of those of resting stage. In addition, these 
      iHR3 females laid a significantly reduced number of eggs per mosquito as compared to 
      those of iMal and the wild type. Our results indicate an important role of HR3 in 
      regulation of 20E-regulated developmental switches during reproductive cycles of A. 
      aegypti females.

AB  - RNA silencing, or RNA interference (RNAi) in metazoans mediates development, reduces 
      viral infection and limits transposon mobility. RNA silencing involves 21-30 
      nucleotide RNAs classified into microRNA (miRNA), exogenous and endogenous small 
      interfering RNAs (siRNA), and Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA). Knock-out, silencing and 
      mutagenesis of genes in the exogenous siRNA (exo-siRNA) regulatory network 
      demonstrate the importance of this RNAi pathway in antiviral immunity in Drosophila 
      and mosquitoes. In Drosophila, genes encoding components for processing exo-siRNAs 
      are among the fastest evolving 3% of all genes, suggesting that infection with 
      pathogenic RNA viruses may drive diversifying selection in their host. In contrast, 
      paralogous miRNA pathway genes do not evolve more rapidly than the genome average. 
      Silencing of exo-siRNA pathway genes in mosquitoes orally infected with arboviruses 
      leads to increased viral replication, but little is known about the comparative 
      patterns of molecular evolution among the exo-siRNA and miRNA pathways genes in 
      mosquitoes. We generated nearly complete sequences of all exons of major miRNA and 
      siRNA pathway genes dicer-1 and dicer-2, argonaute-1 and argonaute-2, and r3d1 and 
      r2d2 in 104 Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected from six distinct geographic 
      populations and analyzed their genetic diversity. The ratio of replacement to silent 
      amino acid substitutions was 1.4 fold higher in dicer-2 than in dicer-1, 27.4 fold 
      higher in argonaute-2 than in argonaute-1 and similar in r2d2 and r3d1. Positive 
      selection was supported in 32% of non-synonymous sites in dicer-1, in 47% of sites 
      in dicer-2, in 30% of sites in argonaute-1, in all sites in argonaute-2, in 22% of 
      sites in r3d1 and in 55% of sites in r2d2. Unlike Drosophila, in Ae. aegypti, both 
      exo-siRNA and miRNA pathway genes appear to be undergoing rapid, positive, 
      diversifying selection. Furthermore, refractoriness of mosquitoes to infection with 
      dengue virus was significantly positively correlated for nucleotide diversity 
      indices in dicer-2.

AB  - CLEC5A/MDL-1, a member of the myeloid C-type lectin family expressed on macrophages 
      and neutrophils, is critical for dengue virus (DV)-induced hemorrhagic fever and 
      shock syndrome in Stat1⁻/⁻ mice and ConA-treated wild type mice. However, whether 
      CLEC5A is involved in the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis has not yet been 
      investigated. To investigate the role of CLEC5A to regulate JEV-induced 
      neuroinflammation, antagonistic anti-CLEC5A mAb and CLEC5A-deficient mice were 
      generated. We find that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) directly interacts with 
      CLEC5A and induces DAP12 phosphorylation in macrophages. In addition, JEV activates 
      macrophages to secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which are 
      dramatically reduced in JEV-infected Clec5a⁻/⁻ macrophages. Although blockade of 
      CLEC5A cannot inhibit JEV infection of neurons and astrocytes, anti-CLEC5A mAb 
      inhibits JEV-induced proinflammatory cytokine release from microglia and prevents 
      bystander damage to neuronal cells. Moreover, JEV causes blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
      disintegrity and lethality in STAT1-deficient (Stat1⁻/⁻) mice, whereas peripheral 
      administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb reduces infiltration of virus-harboring leukocytes 
      into the central nervous system (CNS), restores BBB integrity, attenuates 
      neuroinflammation, and protects mice from JEV-induced lethality. Moreover, all 
      surviving mice develop protective humoral and cellular immunity against JEV 
      infection. These observations demonstrate the critical role of CLEC5A in the 
      pathogenesis of Japanese encephalitis, and identify CLEC5A as a target for the 
      development of new treatments to reduce virus-induced brain damage.

TI  - Human apolipoprotein E peptides inhibit hepatitis C virus entry by blocking virus 
      binding.
PG  - 484-91
LID - 10.1002/hep.25665 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry is a multiple-step process involving a number of host 
      factors and hence represents a promising target for new antiviral drug development. 
      In search of novel inhibitors of HCV infection, we found that a human apolipoprotein 
      E (apoE) peptide, hEP, containing both a receptor binding fragment and a lipid 
      binding fragment of apoE specifically blocked the entry of cell culture grown HCV 
      (HCVcc) at submicromolar concentrations. hEP caused little cytotoxicity in vitro and 
      remained active even if left 24 hours in cell culture. Interestingly, hEP inhibited 
      neither human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-HCV pseudotypes (HCVpp) nor HIV and 
      Dengue virus (DENV) infection. Further characterization mapped the anti-HCV activity 
      to a 32-residue region that harbors the receptor binding domain of apoE, but this 
      fragment must contain a cysteine residue at the N-terminus to mediate dimer 
      formation. The anti-HCV activity of the peptide appears to be dependent on both its 
      length and sequence and correlates with its ability to bind lipids. Finally, we 
      demonstrated that the apoE-derived peptides directly blocked the binding of both 
      HCVcc and patient serum-derived virus to hepatoma cells as well as primary human 
      hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: apoE peptides potently inhibit HCV infection and suggest a 
      direct role of apoE in mediating HCV entry. Our findings also highlight the 
      potential of developing apoE mimetic peptides as novel HCV entry inhibitors by 
      targeting HCV-host interactions.

TI  - PD 404,182 is a virocidal small molecule that disrupts hepatitis C virus and human 
      immunodeficiency virus.
PG  - 672-81
LID - 10.1128/AAC.05722-11 [doi]
AB  - We describe a virucidal small molecule, PD 404,182, that is effective against 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The median 50% 
      inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) for the antiviral effect of PD 404,182 against 
      HCV and HIV in cell culture are 11 and 1 μM, respectively. The antiviral activity of 
      PD 404,182 is due to the physical disruption of virions that is accompanied to 
      various degrees (depending on the virus and exposure temperature/time) by the 
      release of viral nucleic acids into the surrounding medium. PD 404,182 does not 
      directly lyse liposomal membranes even after extended exposure, and it shows no 
      attenuation in antiviral activity when preincubated with liposomes of various lipid 
      compositions, suggesting that the compound inactivates viruses through interaction 
      with a nonlipid structural component of the virus. The virucidal activity of PD 
      404,182 appears to be virus specific, as little to no viral inactivation was 
      detected with the enveloped Dengue and Sindbis viruses. PD 404,182 effectively 
      inactivates a broad range of primary isolates of HIV-1 as well as HIV-2 and simian 
      immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and it does not exhibit significant cytotoxicity with 
      multiple human cell lines in vitro (50% cytotoxic concentration, >300 μM). The 
      compound is fully active in cervical fluids, although it exhibits decreased potency 
      in the presence of human serum, retains its full antiviral potency for 8 h when in 
      contact with cells, and is effective against both cell-free and cell-associated HIV. 
      These qualities make PD 404,182 an attractive candidate anti-HIV microbicide for the 
      prevention of HIV transmission through sexual intercourse.

TI  - Inhibition of influenza A virus replication by antagonism of a PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway 
      member identified by gene-trap insertional mutagenesis.
PG  - 205-15
LID - 10.3851/IMP2080 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Host genes serving potential roles in virus replication may be exploited 
      as novel antiviral targets. METHODS: Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated 
      knockdown of host gene expression was used to validate candidate genes in screens 
      against six unrelated viruses, most importantly influenza. A mouse model of 
      influenza A virus infection was used to evaluate the efficacy of a candidate 
      FDA-approved drug identified in the screening effort. RESULTS: Several genes in the 
      PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway were found to support broad-spectrum viral replication in 
      vitro by RNA interference. This led to the discovery that everolimus, an mTOR 
      inhibitor, showed in vitro antiviral activity against cowpox, dengue type 2, 
      influenza A, rhino- and respiratory syncytial viruses. In a lethal mouse infection 
      model of influenza A (H1N1 and H5N1) virus infection, everolimus treatment (1 
      mg/kg/day) significantly delayed death but could not prevent mortality. Fourteen 
      days of treatment was more beneficial in delaying the time to death than treatment 
      for seven days. Pathological findings in everolimus-treated mice showed reduced lung 
      haemorrhage and lung weights in response to infection. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      provide proof of concept that cellular targets can be identified by gene knockout 
      methods, and highlight the importance of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in supporting 
      viral infections.

      pathogenesis.
PG  - 16534-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1210418109 [doi]
AB  - Alphaviruses, a group of positive-sense RNA viruses, are globally distributed 
      arboviruses capable of causing rash, arthritis, encephalitis, and death in humans. 
      The viral replication machinery consists of four nonstructural proteins (nsP1-4) 
      produced as a single polyprotein. Processing of the polyprotein occurs in a highly 
      regulated manner, with cleavage at the P2/3 junction influencing RNA template use 
      during genome replication. Here, we report the structure of P23 in a precleavage 
      form. The proteins form an extensive interface and nsP3 creates a ring structure 
      that encircles nsP2. The P2/3 cleavage site is located at the base of a narrow cleft 
      and is not readily accessible, suggesting a highly regulated cleavage. The nsP2 
      protease active site is over 40 Å away from the P2/3 cleavage site, supporting a 
      trans cleavage mechanism. nsP3 contains a previously uncharacterized protein fold 
      with a zinc-coordination site. Known mutations in nsP2 that result in formation of 
      noncytopathic viruses or a temperature sensitive phenotype cluster at the nsP2/nsP3 
      interface. Structure-based mutations in nsP3 opposite the location of the nsP2 
      noncytopathic mutations prevent efficient cleavage of P23, affect RNA infectivity, 
      and alter viral RNA production levels, highlighting the importance of the nsP2/nsP3 
      interaction in pathogenesis. A potential RNA-binding surface, spanning both nsP2 and 
      nsP3, is proposed based on the location of ion-binding sites and adaptive mutations. 
      These results offer unexpected insights into viral protein processing and 
      pathogenesis that may be applicable to other polyprotein-encoding viruses such as 
      HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Dengue virus.

PG  - 169-77

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older individuals represent a substantial proportion of international 
      travelers. Because of physiological changes and the increased probability of 
      underlying medical conditions, older travelers might be at higher risk for at least 
      some travel-associated diseases. METHODS: With the aim of describing the 
      epidemiology of travel-associated diseases in older adults, medical data were 
      prospectively collected on ill international travelers presenting to GeoSentinel 
      sites from 1997 to 2009. Seven thousand thirty-four patients aged 60 years and over 
      were identified as older travelers and were compared to 56,042 patients aged 18-45 
      years, who were used as the young adult reference population. RESULTS: The 
      proportionate morbidity of several etiological diagnoses was higher in older ill 
      travelers compared to younger ill, including notably lower respiratory tract 
      infections, high-altitude pulmonary edema, phlebitis and pulmonary embolism, 
      arthropod bites, severe malaria, rickettsiosis, gastritis, peptic ulcers, 
      esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease, trauma and injuries, urinary tract 
      infections, heart disease, and death. In contrast, acute diarrhea, upper respiratory 
      tract infections, flu and flu-like illnesses, malaria, dengue, genital infections, 
      sexually transmitted diseases, and schistosomiasis proportionate morbidities were 
      lower among the older group. CONCLUSION: Older ill travelers are more likely to 
      suffer from certain life-threatening diseases and would benefit from reinforcement 
      of specific preventive measures including use of anti-thrombosis compression 
      stockings and sufficient hydration and exercises during long-distance flights, hand 
      hygiene, use of disposable handkerchiefs, consideration of face-masks in crowded 
      conditions, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, progressive acclimatization to 
      altitude, consideration of acetazolamide, and use of repellents and mosquito nets. 
      Antibiotics for the presumptive treatment of respiratory and urinary tract 
      infections may be considered, as well as antacid medications. At-risk patients 
      should be referred to a specialist for medical evaluation before departing, and 
      optimal control of co-morbidities such as cardiovascular and chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary diseases should be achieved, particularly for high-altitude travel.

      simultaneously to noise and organophosphates in their workplace and to measure 
      tinnitus distress on their quality of life. METHOD:  A retrospective clinical study. 
      We evaluated 82 organophosphate sprinklers from the São Paulo State Regional 
      Superintendence who were active in the fight against dengue and who were exposed to 
      noise and organophosphates. We performed pure tone audiometry and applied the 
      translated THI (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory) questionnaire. RESULTS:  Of the sample, 
      28.05% reported current tinnitus or had presented tinnitus, and the workers with 
      tinnitus had an increased incidence of abnormal audiometry. The average hearing 
      threshold for the 4-8-kHz frequency range of the workers with current tinnitus was 
      higher than that of the others, and was most affected at the 4-kHz frequency. The 
      THI score ranged 0-84, with an average score of 13.1. Twelve (52.17%) workers had 
      THI scores consistent with discrete handicap. CONCLUSION:  There is an increased 
      incidence of abnormal pure tone audiometry in workers with tinnitus, and its impact 
      on the workers' quality of life was discrete. The correlation between average 
      hearing threshold and tinnitus distress was weak.

TI  - Detection of mosquito-only flaviviruses in Europe.

AB  - The genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, includes a number of important 
      arthropod-transmitted human pathogens such as dengue viruses, West Nile virus, 
      Japanese encephalitis virus and yellow fever virus. In addition, the genus includes 
      flaviviruses without a known vertebrate reservoir, which have been detected only in 
      insects, particularly in mosquitoes, such as cell fusing agent virus, Kamiti River 
      virus, Culex flavivirus, Aedes flavivirus, Quang Binh virus, Nakiwogo virus and 
      Calbertado virus. Reports of the detection of these viruses with no recognized 
      pathogenic role in humans are increasing in mosquitoes collected around the world, 
      particularly in those sampled in entomological surveys targeting pathogenic 
      flaviviruses. The presence of six potential flaviviruses, detected from independent 
      European arbovirus surveys undertaken in the Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, Spain 
      and the UK between 2007 and 2010, is reported in this work. Whilst the Aedes 
      flaviviruses, detected in Italy from Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, had already been 
      isolated in Japan, the remaining five viruses have not been reported previously: one 
      was detected in Italy, Portugal and Spain from Aedes mosquitoes (particularly from 
      Aedes caspius), one in Portugal and Spain from Culex theileri mosquitoes, one in the 
      Czech Republic and Italy from Aedes vexans, one in the Czech Republic from Aedes 
      vexans and the last in the UK from Aedes cinereus. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed 
      the close relationship of these putative viruses to other insect-only flaviviruses.
